                    In the past couple of workshops, we’ve covered quite a bit of content regarding how 
					personal information is managed. Ranging from digital assets to identity protection, 
					specific applications strive to help the user in becoming their own central office, 
					especially in the decentralized economy of the blockchain system. Like all functioning 
					information, one’s personal control over data does not necessarily have to be limited to 
					how they control it themselves, but how it’s managed on behalf of something at greater 
					stake, which in this case can be medical records.
					<br><br><br>
					Generally speaking, medical records are typically controlled under the regulations of 
					patient care within hospitals. However, with the ever-progressing capabilities of 
					applications taking over the needs and wants of users, one such application 
					contributing to this particular subject at hand is BurstIQ. As healthcare organizations 
					prioritize organizational strategies for the medical information of patients, this particular 
					tool is helpful for those who prefer scalability in managing biomedical data within a 
					digital world. It uses an encryption method through smart contracts that can be sorted 
					through a built-in tool called lifegraph ™. This enables an average patient to stay in 
					control of their own medical privacy, ensuring data security on behalf of health systems, 
					caregivers, and other service providers.
					<br><br><br>
					Managing personal information, especially when provided by the person who used 
					trusted services of their own, is not an easy feat especially in a centrally-based network. 
					Hence, BurstIQ gives control back to the user when they’re exchanging medical patient 
					information between services. You may be asking, “How is this information shared 
					among professionals who aren’t just friends involved in a smart contract transaction?”. 
					BurstIQ makes use of various features, with the main ones responsible for this 
					functionality being BurstChain ™ and Consent Contracts. These features allow 
					individuals to freely share their medical data anywhere around the globe throughout 
					the global health marketplace. Since medical records transferred and passed by smart 
					contracts count as assets, actively participating individuals who share their information 
					with the health system under BurstIQ are given benefits. These benefits include driving 
					academic research for doctors, keeping up consistent communication with caregivers, 
					and helping businesses specifically promote and sell their own health products 
					alongside other B2B corporations while upholding all of the core privacy rules that must 
					be set in place.
					<br><br><br>
					If you’ve read the previous article to the third part in our series ‘Applications on The 
					Blockchain’, at which we went over identity protection, especially for businesses who 
					must manage customer data when selling a product online, you would have notice that 
					quite some applications pass the corporations through credibility systems, at which 
					BurstIQ strives to do something similar in the healthcare sector. Branching off from 
					privacy controls, the predictability and management of data is key for businesses in 
					healthcare, as a lot of the work does not necessarily become controlled for the work 
					itself but the outcome that comes out of it. As analytics are the main tool used in 
					making sure a certain level of security is set in place for healthcare agencies to be able 
					to handle extensive and intricate health datasets, under once again the BurstChain 
					feature implemented into BurstIQ, other prototypes have also been set in place to 
					enable applications to be able to manage medical records in a decentralized basis, with 
					the specific ones being HealthChain as well as BlockTrial. To avoid errors in mechanisms 
					responsible for assessing data points in a system reliant on storage size and latency, 
					HealthChain aims to provide the same features as BurstChain does in scalability, 
					transparency, and security in the private management of patient data, by upholding 
					compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), a 
					policy set in place in 1996 as a federal law for protecting sensitive client information 
					from being disclosed without the consent of the patient. We have discussed before 
					policies such as this one that aligns and combines with decentralized networks, such as 
					the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a method for combatting against financial 
					misconducts on either national or international levels, set by the G7 summit in 1989.
					<br><br><br>
					The BurstChain™ feature is compliant with the same law, although further developments 
					to the HealthChain prototype are ongoing due to security risks set in place, such as the 
					inability to control important aspects of healthcare activities such as managed service 
					providers (MSPs) within complex adaptive systems (CAs). MSPs are largely responsible 
					for assessing cost and workforce planning in CAs which may range anywhere not just 
					from individual hospitals to ecosystems, something BurstChain excels at improving for 
					relations between patients and caregivers and or businesses. BlockTrial compared to 
					HealthChain is more focused on smart contracts, at which using the default system 
					capabilities of the blockchain technology, uses the exchange method in managing 
					excessive amounts of data generated by trials and their forthcoming results, by storing 
					them in the form of transaction records instead of the clinical information, therefore 
					saving time for latency and storage in the network. For a quick note, latency in 
					blockchain networks is essentially the amount of time that takes place between the 
					submission of a transaction and its follow-up confirmation by the network, a major 
					element in ensuring that hackers do not evade the constant traffic taking place 
					especially when IOTA formatted nodes are set in stone.
					<br><br><br>
					Compliance with HIPAA, ensuring smart contracts are set in place for confirmation of 
					data, improving speed and efficiency in how latency is managed by the network 
					especially in the hands of healthcare professionals, are all of the features that an 
					application must require in order to manage sensitive personal information under a 
					diligent and ethical fashion. Though, this does not mean that adopting such a 
					procedure will completely protect against security hacks, as major yet common security 
					intrusions that we’ve gone over in the workshop series ‘Cybersecurity & Vulnerabilities 
					in Blockchain Technology: The Enebus Attack’, is always going to be prevalent especially 
					when this data is generated and assessed at a greater level beyond the normal speed of 
					which blockchain networks can typically help facilitate transactions (which is 7 
					transactions per second). By the use of examples, in the already existing hemisphere of 
					healthcare technologies in the blockchain, security incidents have taken place 
					threatening the wellbeing of patients, such as a 42% increase in hacking intrusions 
					taking place between 2019 and 2020 due to a network breach for a Canadian medical 
					testing company by the name of LifeLab. Responsible for taking your blood test to be 
					later looked at by family practitioners, hackers with unauthorized access compromised 
					15 million patient records in 2019 and 40 million in 2020, an issue that gave awareness 
					to ongoing security vulnerabilities in centralized networks that may not otherwise be 
					breached at ease in verifiable smart contract transactions on the blockchain. Having 
					mentioned the use of cryptographic keys before, encryption methods within computer 
					networks may help to strengthen information systems of healthcare providers for 
					future reliability by clients.
					<br><br><br>
					The core essential democracy that many experts in the healthcare and blockchain world 
					want is for medical companies to make use of the technology for standards that will 
					enhance interoperability and fight against unwanted uncertainties in data management 
					of patient data under a scalable fashion, minimizing risk of data breach activity and 
					complying overall with medical client consent for management of records on behalf of 
					doctors and healthcare organizations. So to speak, this adoption which for now remains 
					conceptual on a global standard, can be shortened into the acronym HIE, which stands 
					for Health Information Exchange, the simple ability to find ease-of-access and secure 
					shareability methods for electronic health records (EHRs) of patients.
					<br><br><br>
					As much as this is all still a newly understood opportunity by some medical companies, 
					major academia institutions such as MIT Media Lab have already researched and funded 
					projects by granting patients access to their personal data in the hands of a blockchain-
					based platform by the name of MedRec. With this platform, effective management of 
					medical records is done so by creating a list of a patients information within a system, at 
					which it can be documented or shared at any point for when they register or move as a 
					data point within the system architecture, creating security that most medical processes 
					do not make use of as of yet. Altogether, in some major cases, it is important that 
					organizations in need of fine tuning the security and reliability of patient data must 
					recognize the technology for additional cost reduction reasons next to the 
					aforementioned perks, and with how it’s being recognized, it is notable that further 
					development will take place that can eventually scale internationally.
