                    “The whole point of using a blockchain is to let people – in particular, people who don’t 
					trust one another – share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way.”
					<br><br><br>
					– MIT Technology Review
					<br><br><br>
					When it comes to day-to-day transactions, the sole driver of all financial stakes depends 
					on two parties exchanging their finances. As much as this may be a very simple concept, 
					the core concept of this exchange relies on the technology that interconnects various 
					individuals, groups, and organizations under a stream of information. Generally 
					speaking, this can take place when you’re purchasing a coffee, and your account 
					withdrawal for a transaction takes place on machine with PIN pad. Without the right 
					communication between devices, a slight mistake or flaw in transaction may lead to a 
					severe debt crisis over simple everyday needs and wants pursued by each individual.
					<br><br><br>
					In the age of Web 3.0, a new system is being introduced that solely strives to change 
					this format, specifically for peer-to-peer blockchain networks. Through the use of 
					security keys, any purchase of cryptocurrency whether it’s through “stablecoins” or coins 
					in general, is now possible through the blockchain wallet. Although there are security 
					risks involved, considering that the EREBUS attack is a potential flaw when hackers may 
					take over blocks with hash numbers and extract the valuable information of a user on 
					the network, the risks of having an ISP only defines the ever developing technology that 
					will eventually create advanced systems to resolve the problem.
					<br><br><br>
					As of right now, the simple definition of a blockchain wallet despite its flaws, comes 
					down to a piece of hardware that can help an average individual manage 
					cryptocurrencies safely without vulnerabilities involved with the management of security 
					exceeding your ability to make day-to-day transactions. With the use of its personalized 
					storage, it may be instantly connected via USB or other ports, and gives the essential 
					need to the owner with tracking financial information that necessitates various fields of 
					activity ranging from investing, holding digital assets, to communicating exchanges 
					between family members.
					<br><br><br>
					The storage of an average hardware wallet built on the blockchain network, ranges 
					between two categories, the “hot storage” and “cold storage” systems. The ‘cold 
					storage’ mention simply defines what was mentioned earlier, connecting your hardware 
					wallet via USB, in order to perform exchanges between parties. Though this may seem 
					like a safe haven for managing financial information, the alternative solution of ‘hot 
					storage’ proves otherwise, as your hardware wallet is managed via the internet looked 
					over by an ISP (internet service provider). Such instances may relate to the EREBUS 
					hacking attack mentioned before, which has been explained in detail through our 
					Instagram post here.
					<br><br><br>
					As accessing security keys that hold viable information either offline or online has its 
					varying advantages and disadvantages, the core concept that must gain attention is that 
					any individual has ease-of-access to building a portfolio that does not require a grand 
					level of permission by governments or tech-related firms. In our current society, as 
					financial control is strictly emphasized by those who require it the most, this hardware 
					may grow exponentially to support those that are in desperate need of it.
					<br><br><br>
					Because the management of a hardware wallet requires a skillful recollection of safe 
					financial investments, there are a few factors that one must keep in mind when any 
					person demands a high return in their cryptocurrency investment. As this will be 
					explained in detail within further workshops, the core strategies are to work between 
					purchasing digital assets and specialize in investing your money fully or partially into 
					tech companies that have a strong asset behind the cryptocurrency they’re managing. If 
					you have the time to look at our previous workshop regarding the bankruptcy of Silicon 
					Valley Bank, you will come to a realization that ‘stablecoins’ are mainly built within 
					crypto-focused companies that manage funds directly through the network within 
					either ‘derivative securities’ or ‘futures contracts’. To explain these terms, when a 
					‘stablecoin’ managed by a firm is backed up by an asset, they can either be connected 
					directly to a contract that helps one party to agree with buying or selling a certain asset 
					at a specific time period in the future from someone else, or rely on ‘derivative 
					securities’ where the financial value of a cryptocurrency relies on its underlying value 
					from a particular asset. 
					<br><br><br>
					Like the trading market that has its own personalized floor works within a NASDAQ, this 
					same system applies in some cases to an agreement of investing personal finances 
					through cryptocurrency within a hardware wallet in funds managed by Coinbase Global, 
					Robin Markets Inc, PayPal Holdings, etc. As a novice investor, building an investment 
					portfolio with these stablecoins managed by the companies just mentioned requires a 
					significant level of risk tolerance to build financial growth in the long-term, though after 
					time has passed by, the required skillset in developing an ability to identify risks and 
					approach it with the ‘buy low and sell high’ mentality commonly practiced in trading 
					floors, may create an investor known as a “whale” investor. ‘Whale’ investors typically 
					pass their funds through largely risk-based funds that are involved in managing asset-
					based cryptocurrencies, and are likely to receive high returns as a result like an average 
					investor.
					<br><br><br>
					Since there is a security risk in using ‘hot storage’ in blockchain wallets when managing 
					these finances, there is also the same vulnerability in putting funds through companies 
					that may convince clients that the coins are managed by certain assets. In the case of 
					Silicon Valley Bank, lenders, buyers and sellers of bonds, and individuals building 
					portfolios were unable to receive a high return from their investment due to a 
					significant risk in cryptocurrency management that was created by the very corporations 
					that promised to sustain their value without mentioning the use of futures contracts or 
					derivative securities. When it comes to more short-term cases, if one is to build an 
					asset-based portfolio in the blockchain network by risking an investment of some kind, 
					it must be kept in mind that companies that have launched in the short-term are likely 
					to not manage crypto-based clients that may instantly involve themselves in 
					‘stablecoins’ managed and re-evaluated under the NASDAQ by their rightful 
					proprietors.
					<br><br><br>
					For general cases, where you are building an investment portfolio with the blockchain 
					wallet but are significantly unable to create a layer of finances that may be able to 
					support that, individuals interested could begin by discovering ‘airdrops’. ‘Airdrops’, 
					unbeknownst to those who may believe this has to do with iPhone devices, are a special 
					solution to receiving free cryptocurrencies that may be granted to one if they follow a 
					particular social media account. LIke the security risks mentioned before, this must be 
					taken into incredible caution as the world of ‘scamming’ in the digital world of Web 2.0 
					or Web 3.0 is growing considerably larger and may become ever more deceiving, 
					especially those who are not so knowledgeable about the market. To be weary of false-
					promising organization that might offer a grant for followers to receive 
					cryptocurrencies, the best solution is to go on Google and search [“Website” + Scams] 
					or [“Website” + Review]. Because of the fact that this is a new market that an ever 
					growing amount of individuals are realizing all across the globe, it is important that one 
					must take it upon themselves to research into receiving ‘airdrops’ through this particular 
					search method.
					<br><br><br>
					When an average blockchain wallet user may attain the rightful finances and 
					investments into digital assets that with risk tolerance, may grant them high returns, 
					various crypto trading shortcomings must be relinquished in making sure that the 
					portfolio stays healthy. First and foremost, because blockchain technology is built on a 
					particular network, applications such as automated software can be used in controlling 
					purchases of cryptocurrencies on behalf of the user by establishing crypto trading bots. 
					As artificial intelligence is considerably growing into various markets, such use cases can 
					be seen when bots operate with working under a predetermined criteria or algorithm 
					that can make the buying and selling of assets far more efficient, especially for “whale” 
					investors with sizable portfolios. This can also largely contribute to a typical strategy 
					used in finance called the ‘arbitrage strategy’, at which cryptocurrency can be one 
					bought in one market and sold to the other under the premonition that there can either 
					be rapid gains or losses in selling the asset(s) when making movements in pricing 
					solutions in order to optimize profits.
					<br><br><br>
					Separately from the ‘whale investor’, users that make use of the ‘arbitrage strategy’ are 
					called ‘crypto scalpers’, and are effectively skilled at this kind of pricing when trading 
					under the knowledge of the right and wrong behind risk-based asset management. As 
					this is mainly applied during the long-term, short-term solutions include the ‘swing 
					trade strategy’, where different from whale investors and crypto scalpers, an average 
					trader holds their position in a market for a relatively short time. Although this does not 
					always work in effect within volatile cryptocurrency markets, especially those that are 
					short of traffic in ‘stablecoins’, funds managed by companies involved in futures 
					contract are likely to return higher profits for these kinds of trades. Keep in mind that in 
					the mention of ‘assets’, digital assets must be backed by physical ones such as cash, 
					otherwise making them obsolete as they are pushed to rely simply on demand 
					generated by ‘word of mouth’ on social media.
					<br><br><br>
					Returning back to the topic of security, amongst these investing strategies, holding 
					them securely over a long period of time especially within bear markets are significantly 
					important in avoiding major losses that are associated with negative word of mouth or 
					security intrusions. As these investments derived from the blockchain wallet usually take 
					place within various markets, where crypto ‘whales’, crypto scalpers, and short-term 
					traders have the ability to liquidize cryptocurrency holdings from their portfolio within 
					bear markets as long as they are backed up by cash, this interconnection between 
					digital and physical assets may allow one to invest into capital management strategies 
					within bear markets. Though this interconnection may suggest significant opportunities, 
					it must be kept in mind that two specific improvements in security must be kept in mind 
					when ensuring that the portfolios are not corrupted by unanimous hackers, which is 
					done through either ‘crypto staking’ or ‘crypto borrowing.
					<br><br><br>
					The concept of ‘crypto staking’ goes full circle into the security system behind hardware 
					wallets, where you are essentially locking up a specific amount of your cryptocurrencies 
					in a wallet that follows the process of staking, where keeping these financial assets for a 
					prolonged used of time can validate network transactions or supply liquidity to others. 
					Second to this, ‘crypto borrowing’ provides an alternative option for those who are not 
					seeking to liquidize their assets to make investments in bear markets but would like to 
					make use of them for collateral, which is offered by applications such as “Borrow” in 
					order to help customers convert digital assets into cryptocurrencies or to exchange 
					them as collateral for stablecoins when wanting to purchase items or to generate 
					passive income.
					<br><br><br>
					In conclusion, the interconnection between technology and finance more than ever is 
					readily available to those needing a ‘private’ way to manage their finances, and does not 
					require permission but more or less the comfort within a peer-to-peer network. Various 
					investment strategies, risk-tolerances, general research behind making sure your assets 
					don’t fall into the wrong hands, and making sure it is all done securely, provide what is 
					the future of having individual freedom in pursuing the growth a portfolio that will 
					ultimately grant more eligibility in understanding a digital world that doesn’t follow 
					limitations.
