        <h1> Your Hard Drive </h1>
        <h3> Is Now Currency</h3>
      <p>
        In the past, various coins that have been covered and were linked to cryptocurrency worked 
        under the simple rule of thumb that, you connected to something that you were in control. In 
        such instances, the only involvement of that connection would specifically be some 
        hardware, or simply developing a minted identity on the blockchain network via 
        decentralized applications catered towards controlling or managing certain finances. Unless 
        you were to make use of an ASIC machine (Application Specific Integrated System) for 
        cryptocurrency mining, normally the process for actually investing into a cryptocurrency, be 
        it the reliable form of stable coins, or the simple process of getting involved in the risk filled 
        hemisphere of buying altcoins with false promises on behalf of its creators, it is essential to 
        get to the base point that, most cryptographic activity does not require much.

        The subject in this article tends to challenge that fact, with something called ChiaCoin, a 
        cryptocurrency that aims to allow the purchasing or selling of your currency to take place 
        within a hard drive. That’s correct, hard drives are not just used for day-to-day storage, but 
        to also enable the allowance of data transfers on a decentralized system largely relating to 
        financial transactions. But, how does this happen? As we’ve covered other topics in the past, 
        such as the hardware wallet, the system in of itself has parts and components that mainly 
        relate to the general functionality of simply translating encrypted data into the cyclical format 
        of buying and selling something.

        In this particular instance, the same applies to ChiaCoin, which really aims to use the hard 
        drive to shift decentralized control to the user in a fashion that the individual and makes 
        them as if they are their own organization. Large in concept, this is done so through a variety 
        of processes, one of them being something called the Proof of Capacity protocol. Other 
        methods of cryptocurrency have of course been mentioned in the past, this being proof of 
        work of course, and the newer and most efficient way of verifiging users on a network, proof 
        of stake. But, how does proof of capacity work exactly?

      <p>
        Referring back to the ASIC machine earlier, in this particular case, PoC uses the advantage 
        of connecting a hard drive to any kind of network, in order to decentralize the process of 
        these data exchanges between other users, similar to how you’d perceive an ADHOC 
        network, where using any sort of operating software, you could intentionally trade your data 
        with other computers without having to setup an internet router by any means. But, past this, 
        there is a certain type of PoC that most are not aware of, and that is called ‘Conditioned 
        Proof of Capacity’. As the term suggests, compared to lesser eco friendly and more 
        computer intensive currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or DogeCoin, using cPoC, a 
        particular protocol called zk-SNARK, which stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-
        Interactive Argument of Knowledge’.

        As complex as it sounds, it holds a basic meaning, which is that in a transaction, two users 
        can exchange information that doesn’t necessarily have to be directly financial, at which 
        whatever they may exchange as information does not need to be revealed. For example, 
        the reason why passwords are needed to be registered on a website, is to be able to assign 
        specific contents of characters with a limit, so that the website could register and identify the 
        person making use of whatever it is they must do with their account on that website. In this 
        case, that protocol is used for cPoC, in order to allow safer transactions to take place under 
        ChiaCoin, at which ecosystem friendliness does not necessarily just limit itself to saving 
        some computing power, but to optimize it as well.

        Next to the zk-SNARK protocol being the ultimate leeway for anonymous exchanges to 
        happen far more faster than it would with reveals of verifiable data under an ETH protocol for 
        example, another method that used to make a system use a hard drives resources is of that 
        with proof of space, at which, you are simply making use of Proof of Capacity to simply 
        resource the storage device towards meeting certain needs that an ASIC machine could do 
        in balance, without having to require major GPU power. But, the use of a storage device with 
        proof of space methods does not necessarily imply that significantly more power is saved 
        than say normal cryptocurrency mining, and if not for that, the ideal process of actually 
        making transactions under cPoC and avoiding any extra power to be spent.

        As mentioned in the previous workshop regarding how energy used in cryptocurrency mining 
        requires many TwH of power as much as the sun could provide, ChiaCoin does aim to 
        address this by understanding the distribution of renewable energy. It is essential to 
        understand that next to general use, the major compounded expenses of cryptocurrency 
        mining when it comes to energy use applies here to ChiaCoin as well, but its methods for 
        general transactions differ far more than meets the eye.

        When it comes to general encryption methods, or more so, the process of ‘hashing’ 
        something to generate a number, the method of using storage blocks for cryptocurrency can 
        be utilized via through something called seed phrases. Seed phrases, are simply just 
        sequential sets of randomly generated words, that act as a major password for encrypted 
        keys that allow access to allwets and so on. Major cryptocurrency exchanges such as 
        Coinbase use this, and it is especialy important for ChiaCoin as it allows quicker access to a 
        wallet without having to reveal or share information, hence linking back to the cPoC protocol 
        and its zk-SNARK methods.

        That’s not to say that, ChiaCoin doesn’t enable newer and more advanced ways of mining its 
        currency, regardless of how much power it requires, which factually speaking could require 
        all of Poland for an operation to take place. Of course, we are not attempting anyone to 
        attempt cryptocurrency mining, hence why we are educating on this topic instead. Since 
        there’s a long range of personalities in the blockchain hemisphere, that being of 
        cryptocurrency miners split subjectively to be anywhere between investors to real-time and 
        dedicated farmers, on the farmer spectrum of understanding and obstaining ChiaCoin via 
        PoC, there are methods to reduce operational costs, such as JBODs, recertified drives, and 
        plot compression.

      <p>
        Starting off with JBODs, which quite legitimately stands for ‘Just A Bunch of Disks’, this 
        particular method for storage simply involves taking a collection of hard disks and saving 
        power by combining them into one volume within a system for a better function of saving 
        operational costs. IN addition, to this, there is recertified drives. To explain this in simple 
        detail, every product has something called an OEM number, which simply is just a set of 
        characters that verifies that the manufacturer has labelled and confirmed that the product at 
        hand is usable, and may not may not be given warranty depending on certain policies. In this 
        special instance, recertified drives are simply just a way for the OEM number to link back to 
        the manufacturer, that can largely confirm that the drive has been tested and can be used for 
        computing processed.

      <p>
        And of course, you have something called plot compression for hard disks, which simply 
        means, taking a lot of file data and compressing it, at which the more data there is to 
        compress, the more power it will require to do that for the short-term. All of these methods 
        for mining ChiaCoin are optimal solutions that can be professionally executed depending on 
        how serious the farmer is about profiting off of the cryptocurrency, but more important 
        beyond that, it is important to mention that sustainability is increasingly becoming more 
        important as time moves forward.

        It is for this reason, that in order to negotiate lesser environmentally damaging methods of 
        working with cryptocurrency for the general public, developers explore alternative consensus 
        mechanisms that go far past the original SHA-256 algorithm, this being other protocols such 
        as Proof of Space and Time or PoST for short. To simply put, unlike exchanging hidden 
        information between two parties on a blockchain via cPoS, in this case PoST asks that a 
        person verifies that they have the storage space needed in order to hold certain information 
        over a period of time for transactional activities under ChiaCoin.

        Now, bare in mind that, this information split between owners of ChiaCoin is going to make 
        of major supply increases of tokens on the blockchain market, henceforth, why we have 
        something called the process of halving. Halving, is the ideal process of taking crypto supply 
        coins, and to curb long-term inflation. There have been concise explanations regarding how 
        negative and positive price elasticity has an impact on the cryptocurrency market, so in this 
        case, when it comes to combatting negative price elasticity with the consequential rise of 
        inflation common in modern macroeconomics today, the process of halving simply means 
        that you are cutting the production of the tokens by 50% in order to avoid higher inflation but 
        to also increase the chances of tokens to be rewarded and valued at higher prices when 
        rewarded to others, that possibly being done so through air drops that aren’t part of pyramid 
        schemes.

        So, you’re probably wondering, how much space on a hard drive is required even to farm or 
        trade using ChiaCoin? Generally speaking, due to higher trading volume, scarcity, and 
        halving processes which can even heighten prices of the currency to at least 60% on certain 
        occassions, around 4TB to 18TB are recommended to meet the demands of the trading
        as next to investing, farmers have statistically proven that the coin itself easy
        takes up anywhere between 512GB in an SSD within 40 days of use and 2TB if used for
        for at least 160 days. This is considering that, for the requirements of Polands entire power usage, which 
        compared to basic ASIC machine, is about 30 times more energy consumption, mining 
        ChiaCoin even with the use of plot compressions and using JBODs will still require 
        significantly more storage cases as a result which of course, depending on how you budget 
        your storage, costs a lot of money.

        It’s already enough effort to purchase games today in 2024 that don’t require less than 
        100GB of storage, henceforth why storage division and optimization would be key in 
        instances for the future where ChiaCoin is prevalent in the Web 3.0 era. Speaking of the new 
        era of mining hard drive currencies, it is exceptionally important to note that, there are lots of 
        newer developments happening in the traditional cryptocurrency sphere that aims to push 
        the limits opf endeavoring this expensive method of profiting off the blockchain, at which 
        initiatives such as the BXTB (which stands for ‘Blockchain Exchange Token Bonus), aims to 
        require a stablecoin infrastructure where halving can be automated in the realm of owning a 
        stake in a currency and to be reward it simultaneouslhy, hence calling it a two-token system. 
        The two tokens, are as put, between the stable coin which is named CHIP for something to 
        be small but valuable, and the reward token which by code goes for YBXTB.

        After all of this, it is especially important to note that, the basic principles that ranged all the 
        way from Bitcoin still exist with ChiaCoin, this being that cryptocurrency miners still 
        necessitate validation on the network regardless of the use of protocols such as cPoC, and 
        that rewarding for mining a block and expanding networks still exist. Overall, this is one of 
        those currencies that hold more importance over function than it does with history compared 
        to other workshops mentioned in the past, and it’s a fact to be known that ANY hard drive 
        can be used in this instance, especially for something like an Android smartphone or 
        possible iPhone if the jailbreaking community thrives to make this possible.
