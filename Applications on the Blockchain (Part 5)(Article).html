        <h1> Applications on the Blockchain (Part 5) </h1>
				<h3> Real Estate (Propy) </h3>
      <p>
        Separate yet prior to what we’ll be discussing in todays article, amongst one of the 
					valued elements of blockchain technology that can help a user practice a safe conduct 
					of personal data management, transparency between how customers and companies 
					communicate is upmost important in determining what makes either a transaction safe 
					to be validated or by all means invalid if there’s any suspicion. As this relatively new 
					technology is still connecting to various industries, that in the future, will solidify how 
					we perform transactions, amongst one of the major concerns is how real estate can be 
					managed an assessed by certain parties.

        If you’ve checked our first part to this workshop series ‘Blockchain & Art Entertainment 
					(What’s the Metaverse & NFTs?)’, you likely learned that the transfer of assets between 
					various users is largely trafficked due to its profit system of virtual mechanisms at which 
					cryptocurrencies are held as the main facility of control. Generally speaking, as these 
					assets could be mapped out in their various formats through digital marketplaces or 
					land-based graphical visualizations like you may see through Web 3.0 applications such 
					as Upland, one particular tool strives to create a lenient format for which this level of 
					variance with real estate could be simplified if not held to an advanced tier of high 
					financial returns.

        This application goes by the name Propy, and is built as an interface that provides 
					greater flexibility for users who have an ambition in pursuing real estate in a private 
					sector held under a decentralized environment. The particular model of this instance is 
					similar to that of purchasing property with the help of a mortgage broker, though 
					instead you are doing the equivalent of creating a portfolio in the same sense by 
					purchasing or sharing similar assets under the Propy application. A key feature of the 
					application which may work both domestically or internationally, is that it entices 
					exploration of opportunities in financing personal real estate beyond where you may be 
					living, helping to exceed the control to the user than the average brokerage and 
					housing services mentioned from before.

      <p>
        As investing into such an aspect of the financial markets with promising returns 
					in the long-run could be tedious at times, this particular application solely relies on secure 
					transactions based on a private token called PRO, which serves as a benefactor for 
					permission that a user must call for when looking to make a transaction while holding 
					their own governance over a particular node within the system. Referring to our article 
					about how Audius serves to be a platform for music listeners and artists to freely share 
					their work online without major restrictions, Propy like Audius, helps in making use of 
					tokens to create the same permutable adjustments in data transfers that does not 
					necessarily have to be narrowed down to one way of financing an asset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, you are likely wondering how such a transaction could potentially work within an 
					application that promises a diverse way of investing into real estate. To simply put, when 
					mapping the relationship between the buyer and the seller, either party must agree to 
					sign a smart contract at which the person selling has specifically established an LLC 
					based from the US, in order to ensure that property from the buyer can be inspected 
					with the full verification that the user providing it owns it within that time period. This is 
					particularly guaranteed in such instances where you are holding an NFT auction, which 
					is almost always the case when seeking a profitable transaction within the network. In 
					addition to this, similar to what was discussed before in articles emphasizing on the use 
					of blockchain wallets how they’re helping to build financial portfolios can provide great 
					resource accessibility for the user (read ‘How to Invest Using a Blockchain Wallet’), the 
					Propy token(s) can also serve as an airdrop at which they are promised to be earned 
					freely under the conditions that a user must follow particular activities that will likely 
					grant them permission to receive and make use of them. This works separately from 
					how a government would choose to use the application, as Propy tokens are divided 
					between tasking the user in earning the small supply of tokens when joining the 
					platform, visiting a particular property as a form of inspection, and either listing or 
					sharing the listing of property. Governments in the other hand, may simply earn a return 
					in tokens under the regulation that they perform enough successful transactions 
					themselves, as the proven security of Propy is established on behalf of their policies 
					such as creating an LLC.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="box blur" id="box6">
      <div class="arrow">

        <button class="lock-button" onclick="toggleLock(this)">🖍️</button>
      <p>
        In addition to the process of the transaction itself, like an average Web 3.0 website 
					showcasing the available market for NFTs, Propy has its own marketplace called the 
					Network Growth Pool. Through NGP, with the supply of 100 million tokens under 
					Propy’s currency, around 45% of the total (or 35 million of them) are distributed for 
					sharing within this marketplace to serve as a platform for users to allocate their earnings 
					into property offerings. As the history of all of the terms I’ve mentioned thus far in this 
					article require some form of registration through the network itself with the help of 
					tokens, Propy makes use of the Propy Registry protocol which serves as a ledger at 
					which the transfer of recorded properties by different users are provided a legal status 
					at which they can be verified, not only confirming the validity of transactions but also 
					ensuring that the traffic of them are sustained efficiently. As a side note, when it comes 
					to blockchain technology, a ledger is simply just a log (either physical or digital) that 
					records the ongoing transactions associated with any part of a financial system that 
					takes place within or in parallel to it.

      <p>
        As I’ve mentioned before, with every application, there may still come to be flaws in 
        security at which transparency may not necessarily be practiced in the decentralized real 
        estate community especially under this branch. This may include transaction records not 
        being validated due to coding defects, at which the major solution involves repeating 
        the transaction until the parties set in place may correctly use LLCs to confirm the 
        buying and selling of their property, in order to help it remain visible on the ledger. 
        Second to this, a major shield to other security flaws which could include an intruder 
        attempting to alter or manipulate shared instances of transactions by users without 
        their rightful confirmation which has been proved as explained in our series 
        ‘Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Blockchain Technology: The Erebus Attack’, Propy makes 
        it so that you must make a specific entrance with permission in order to participate in 
        the legal buying and selling of the showcased properties. How this is done is that the 
        user themselves pay a fee for the reservation of a particular listing, hence giving them a 
        number of tokens in return, at which outside of the network a qualified broker is 
        notified and requests that the seller confirms their receipt of the particular deposit that 
        was made. A great aspect of this feature, is that it also includes a fair combination of by
        -laws, similar to the kind of regulation we’ve seen with issued governmental policies such 
        as the FATF (Financial Action Task Force), the buyer and the seller within the transaction 
        must be obligated to look over and fit under the rules of certain policies such as the 
        Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) documentations to verify 
        that the procedure of the transaction is completed.

        If you have made it this far into the article, you’ve likely noticed that the combination 
					between regulatory management combatting irregular activities within financial markets 
					which is seen in our normal economy, is now merging with a fully decentralized world. 
					Regarding this overlap of systems, it is simply a sign that full control to the user over 
					their own desires in portfolio investments, is given a safeguard similar to the crypto 
					architecture of other applications we’ve covered in past workshops. Though patterns of 
					usability with portfolio management in connection to Propy amongst other clients is 
					becoming ever more consistent as developers seek to break the boundaries of this 
					technology, it would be nothing short in saying that we are not omniscient in the 
					disadvantages that come with these platforms.

        On top of the possible security flaws we’ve mentioned before, Propy doesn’t entirely 
					encapsulate the transactions of property between buying and selling parties through 
					the mechanism of non-fungible tokens themselves, since they work under a different set 
					of given rules by the developers. To be frank, there are more costs with the process 
					behind verifying real estate with Propy than there is with NFT auctions, as you are 
					having to establish a limited liability company (LLC) that has far greater expenses 
					especially on the behalf of the US government, since they include include an increase in 
					having to administrate efforts and costs of assessed portfolios within the system, where 
					limitations may ensue due to how a decentralized transfer of data between two or more 
					parties in a transaction isn’t ultimately possible when fully legal establishments are not 
					set in place. This is largely due to the fact that governments and organizations are only 
					just in the process of establishing an avenue for this to take place, with the second 
					aspect being that Propy itself does not have its own private and secure transaction 
					system so that tokens do not have to be purchased directly from a third-party source 
					instead of directly from the source. Returning back to the notion of how merging digital 
					systems are still ongoing in their developments when trying to align with real-world 
					policies, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) formed the equivalent of 
					the FATF with the Blockchain Task Force, at which under the rules of their member state 
					the CWS (Committee on WIPO Standards), a specific law is to be registered at which IPs 
					must be outlined within blockchain technologies to be facilitated within an ecosystem 
					that practices various challenges that must be overcome such as governance over what 
					is being bought and sold between responsible authority, the ability for advanced 
					computing systems to make use of and exchange information at a substituted level, to 
					altogether create a manner at which discourse or turmoil in security is combatted and 
					limited within private and public sectors.

        As the discussion and implementation of these rules by WIPO and Propy is being 
					developed to reach an end goal, there still remains to be competition that branches 
					from these tools which may promise to further adjust how future businesses are 
					communicating with each other regardless of the industry they’re connected with. These 
					include Web 3.0 clients such as ShelterZoom or StreetWire, that try to fully digitalize the 
					intertwining between workforces within a business by making use of blockchain-based 
					software through grounding of the SaaS (Software As A Service) protocol, which is used 
					to divert the nodes of a network into a particular software that may make use of them 
					(please check out our workshop ‘Blockchain and Identity Protection’ for further context). 
					Altogether, it is safe to say that the development in structure for the users control is 
					more or less becoming abundant in sectors that were once only known to be 
					centralized, at which our transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 will only become more 
					fluent in its efficacy as a result.
