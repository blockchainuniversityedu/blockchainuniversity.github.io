                    In this weeks workshop, we’ll discuss a disguised security vulnerability that most users of 
					blockchain technology may not be aware of from the get-go of using applications. As 
					we’ve covered topics such as making use of blockchain wallets, what is advised and not 
					recommended in the realm of managing securities behind digital assets as well as 
					finances, solely relies not just the general structure of the network, but also the people 
					who find loop holes in the system and take advantage of it.
					<br><br><br>
					Generally speaking, when a blockchain network is run, each user functions under a 
					specific node that consists of salt, identified by a hash number, and connected by the 
					previous user before it. It can be thought of as a branch of networks, each individually 
					following each other in the management of data resources that can work at specific 
					speeds. Generally speaking, a general transaction between two parties can work up to a 
					speed of 7 transactions per second, but thanks to applications such as IOTA everything 
					can be interconnected in an open-sourced data within a multi-sourced validation 
					system that’s open to the public.
					<br><br><br>
					The general message to see here, is that in the midst of developers and engineers 
					establishing a certain speed to the general performance of transactions, security 
					disruptions especially by third parties that hold a certain level of familiarity with the 
					network structure will rely on the vulnerabilities of the nodes in order to extract a large amount of personal data, at a large scale. This is where the Enebus attack takes place, a method for hackers to invade networks on the blockchain exchanging transactions either through an IOTA format or normally, in order to perform 51% attacks that can cripple portfolios of those managing their money in the system.
					<br><br><br>
					For some context, the term salt means a random storage of data secured through the 
					access of data, and is especially existent through hot storage that a person access by 
					the use of blockchain wallets. You may read more about this in our previous articles, but 
					considering our discussion is reliant on security atacks, the 51% vulnerability is 
					essentially a step in which hackers enter a pool of transactional nodes within the 
					network responsible for verifying an exchange in cryptocurrencies or digital assets, and 
					assume control over 51% of the ongoing processes. Generally speaking, the verificiation 
					of the currencies and assets within the network is called blockchain mining, and is 
					generally the term hackers want to hear when seeking the extraction of data at a 
					bolstering speed that invades protection of valued identifications at a high rate.
					<br><br><br>
					Now, since the alternative to using a hot storage to access personal information within 
					blockchain wallets can be varied depending on the activitiy you’re involved in, cold 
					storage methods are more or less recommended since ISPs will not be required to 
					access the same level of information. Generally speaking, despite the way the network is 
					built under a decentralized format for the freedom of the user, cold storages branch to 
					various solutions that uphold value for those who are simply seeking to perform day-to-
					day purchases and investments. Some of the branches of cold storage access methods 
					are L2s (Layer 2 Solutions) as well as sidechains. Since the speed and scale of 
					transactions is what attracts the hackers to perform the 51% attack, cold storage 
					security solutions works like layers to an onion. You have Layer-1 which is the main 
					blockchain system itself, where Layer-2 serves as a way to increase higher transaction 
					output by creating a third-party protocol that reduces the cost of making the exchanges 
					as well as enhances speed. Because nodes are essentially functioning under hash 
					numbers with security addresses, a set of them within an IOTA smart contract protocol 
					work under the L2 layer solution as it’s on-chain, which mentioned from before in our 
					first article, is essentially a set of transactions that take place within the blockchain.
					<br><br><br>
					A lot of the terms mentioned here, off-chain or on-chain, work under the main network 
					whereas a separate chain may exist, called the sidechain. The sidechain works in parallel 
					to the core of the onion so to speak, as it’s an extra strain of the blockchain that serves 
					as an offline way for digital assets to be exchanged. As of right now, offline storages are 
					the best way to combat the 51% attacks, but since hackers are clever with finding 
					alternative loop holes and methods considering that the security behind the technology 
					is still in the development stage, algorithms in the blockchain network vulnerable to the 
					security intrusion can be susceptibl to Sybil attacks as well. As we’ll eventually go over 
					the protection against identity fraud in further workshops with the help of applications, 
					a preview into the ongoing problems is through the Sybil attacks, where a hacker may 
					create numerous fake identities on the network that can be easily forgone if not 
					carefully seen by the party interacting with them for a transaction. Generally speaking, 
					these hackers find a way to take advantage of the hot storage access to networks by 
					making use of invalid private keys and falsely tampering with them so that the identity 
					is created. This is usually done so when other users do not make use of two-factor 
					authentication in order to protect their personal credentials, and therefore either have 
					their L1 or L2 addresses misconstrued with other users, creating a third-party mixup that 
					can disrupt the speed of numerous exchanges taking place.
					<br><br><br>
					Now you might be wondering, how can someone’s personal information get into a 
					third-party mixup with other hackers? To simply put, because the verifications of 
					exchanges in the network rely on smart contracts, a simple flaw in the coding next to 
					the lack of having 2FA over your accounts can create irreversible intrusions that will help 
					the hacker establish control over your network. Though, in the opposite direction, if a 
					smart contract is fully secured without defects in the code, it is simply unbreachable by 
					the hacker. Either way, enabling two-factor authentification, will not only prevent long-
					term attacks but also help you privately secure transactions while smoothly keeping 
					tracking of how your data is managed.
					<br><br><br>
					Next to the surface level attacks that can happen at any point in a busy network of 
					blockchain transactions, some of the minor ones that are also figured to be equally 
					damageable towards how users manage their portfolios is the short address attack and 
					race attack. To put it into Layman’s terms, the short address attack is specifically notable 
					in how Ethereum is exchanged under the ERC-20 standard, at which a hacker is capable 
					of manipulating the data behind a smart contract within the Ethereum network in order 
					to make it include data than was sent. On average, the term ‘short address’ in this 
					special instance implies that the address behind the smart contract is shortened so that 
					instead of a 20 byte-long string of numbers, it is shortened in order for the intruder to 
					receive or send more ETH tokens than usual. It is essentially a form of deceptive hacking 
					within the ERC-20 mainframe, which must be taken note of when managing such a 
					vastly used cryptocurrencies. Similar to this, the other instance is the race attack, which 
					expands beyond ETH but returns to the disruption of smart contract security in a busy 
					onchain network. To simply put, in a race attack, a hacker with multiple computing 
					systems can create two transactions at the same time for each user in the network by 
					establishing the initial exchange between a digital asset and the payment for it, where 
					multiple users will accept the same payment for their property without a proper 
					confirmation, leading to the hacker receiving the asset and their initial payment as the 
					exchange was not verified. The major reason for this attack, is simply because one of the 
					parties in the exchange does not await confirmation for the payment, creating theft of 
					property that cannot always be combatted through minting since once the attack has 
					happened, the hacker may have a fake identity that will make them uneasy to track 
					down.
					<br><br><br>
					By now, within a large or small scale, you have learned the major tweaks that a hacker 
					can perform towards a network in order to merit from the existing loopholes that those 
					on the opposite side of the transaction simply become a victim to experiencing. One of 
					the core reasons as to why this is an ongoing issues that hasn’t exactly established on a 
					core solution, is that enough security habits are not demonstrated for users to keep in 
					mind of when investing their own personal finances into the technology for a possible 
					return. Next to awaiting confirmation when a security intrusion takes place, enabling 
					two-factor authentication, the deeper issues involve a lack of communication and trust, 
					a problem with application development that can range between hundreds if not 
					thousands of developers largely involving code defects, and last but not least the early 
					stage of smart contracts crossing paths in an on-chain or off-chain set of nodes.
					<br><br><br>
					If you read our previous article on the contribution of blockchain technology to various 
					industries such as music, applications such as Audius avoid the aforementioned errors 
					by creating a space for users to purchase their private cryptocurrency, allowing them to 
					take full control over a specific node in order to secure smart contract exchanges, which 
					is a method effective in preventing 51% attacks by hackers, as the user assumes 
					decentralized governance over a part of the crypto-based set of nodes rather than 
					entirely relying on third-party sources that may not always be effective especially with 
					the state of how an L1 or L2 address can be tampered with by any security intruder. 
					Altogether, as this doesn’t just apply to the Web 3.0 space but Web 2.0 as well, always 
					be sure to set the right authentications towards your accounts, and maintain a certain 
					level of awareness over the businesses you trust your data with, as not all of them can 
					be trusted which can be partially exemplified by our article covering the downfall of 
					Silicon Valley Bank.
