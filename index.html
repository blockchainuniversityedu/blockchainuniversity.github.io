        </div>
        <p>BlockchainUniversity is an organization run by students focus on creating a space for people of all educational levels (mostly focused on university students) on the important
          principles of blockchain technology. We want to be able to source valid information about blockchain technology within an engaging format, without taking up too much of
          ones time.
        </p>
        <p> So far, in the past we were mostly focused on educating students from Toronto Metropolitan University on this subject, but now we'd like to expand and hope to increase
          the general scope of blockchain education on multiple communities at once, as we're aware that the Web 3.0 era is emerging at an incredibly fast pace alongside
          the tools that is reaching the current generation of our internet.
