                    “The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.”
					<br><br><br>
					– Tim Berners-Lee
					<br><br><br>
					As we’ve discussed a wide range of topics regarding applications built on blockchain 
					networks, as well as how the technology itself is able to help one’s assets and finances 
					get managed under the right rules set by the user, it is important to differentiate this 
					ever-developing era of technology to what we are currently using today.
					<br><br><br>
					If you are reading this article, then you’re also an avid user of Web 2.0, the sole stage of 
					the internet that everyone currently is on. The concept of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 ranges 
					back to its sole origin, which began with Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the three 
					letters you see in the URL of every website, WWW. As this may seem like a simple 
					feature of how websites appeal to an average user, it is very much the core driver of 
					how people connect to the information they seek on a day-to-day basis.
					<br><br><br>
					Like blockchain networks, applications built on Web 2.0 range from a large multitude of 
					resources detailing social media, the use of mobile apps on your phone, as well as the 
					management of financial information through central institutions. Altogether, the 
					development of the web, which began with Web 1.0, is constantly streamlining but at a 
					pace which an average person may not be able to catch up to as our needs must be 
					align with what applications in newer eras of the internet can offer.
					<br><br><br>
					With that being said, we will be going over the difference between what we are using 
					today and what may be used for the future in detail, going beyond the surface level of 
					what everyone may perceive at the beginning. When it comes to Web 2.0, the main 
					technicalities alongside its advantages and disadvantages is our ability to stay 
					connected with each other, and that has been made possible by various CEOs and 
					entrepeneurs to such an extent by communicating the packages we buy and sell 
					through Amazon, using systems that help us to achieve productive tasks with the help 
					of Apple, and being able to access a worldwide collection of information with the use of 
					Google, and watching our favorite TV shows and movies through Netflix.
					<br><br><br>
					Compared to the 20th century, our ability to connect at ease with each other has 
					significantly changed through Web 2.0, and will only become more privatized by the 
					choice of the user. Though, this comes with its disadvantages, with the main ones being 
					that regulation is not always in par with the content we see on a daily basis. Through 
					Web 2.0 applications, we are the height of misinformation, where a centralized office of 
					information reaching the viewership of internet users may develop a double-edged 
					sword, where you’re accessing a user experience that makes your life more interactive 
					and user-friendly, whilst also processing the limitless creation of platforms under social 
					media applications, blogs, and various other online formats that can ensue discord if 
					not carefully reviewed. That’s not to say that this isn’t the choice of the individual, as the 
					information one consumes and reviews is entirely dependant on their own pursuit of 
					interests.
					<br><br><br>
					The format of centralization, like decentralized applications, face similar security issues 
					as everything is set to one office. As we’re transitioning into the Web 3.0 era, the central 
					consumption of content is going to become decentralized, where one will have the right 
					not to have to work under monopolies that have control over what they consume based 
					on interests. Because there is a certain level of syndication that goes behind making 
					sure applications let one take control over what they’re doing, applications that grow to 
					show concern over this problem are still stuck in the Web 2.0 bubble, where companies 
					mentioned before such as Amazon claim ownership of reviews that other post onto 
					product pages on their site, as well as executives behind Google guarding the 
					administration of its systems, networking processes, and hosting a query of search 
					engine tools that the user may make use of to find resources they need becoming an 
					addressal to security vulnerablities that have been taken advantage of in the past.
					<br><br><br>
					When it comes to smaller yet grandiose tools that we use on a weekly basis, such as 
					GMail, the personal information we pass through is largely stacked through web user 
					interfaces that suggest a traditional sense of richness to how you can handle your data 
					under the control of a greater office, especially when its exclusively available to those 
					using a laptop or mobile device. As this procedure of data management is largely 
					dependant on coding languages, such as Linux, MySQL, PHP, Python, and et cetera, the 
					methods of P2P (peer-to-peer) are widely advantageous for advanced uses of managing 
					personal communications desired by people who are in great need of it within 
					professional and casual environments. Though, treating the web as a platform for these 
					kinds of activities at the hands of monopolies and oligopolies as well as their customers, 
					was not always a general given approach to how tools were built on the internet.
					<br><br><br>
					In the first stage of the internet ranging from the mid-90s to early 2000s, especially 
					before the creation of “www” in URLs, the competition between companies wanting to 
					take over the interent systems wanted to create a mashup of tools that could access it 
					in a convenient fashion. Throughout our modern day, it is relatively easy to find an app 
					on a phone or a program on a device, and not have to make it specifically available 
					through the device you initially purchased, hence why the Internet Explorer was a core 
					driver of internet exploration at the time before other browsers such as Google Chrome 
					and Firefox came along. More specifically, the ability to access internet to achieve all of 
					the limits of software-based activity at the time was solely made possible by an 
					application many of us have at least heard of at some point, “Netscape”.
					<br><br><br>
					The application was designed to make sure the internet was accessed as a platform 
					through the software, by developing a market for internet access achieved through 
					browsers to eventually act as a “webtop” which would make information easily 
					accessible compared to before. This of course, in the PC market at the time, without 
					Google’s centralized servers connecting from its browsers, to the search engine, to the 
					content service all at once being at play, led to slower network connections considering 
					the average internet speed at the time was between 15 – 50 KB/s. Eventually, when ISPs 
					began to take over the market to enable this accessible internet to become faster 
					alongside the applications that required its use at the time, especially with newer 
					creations such as the ability to access a feed of information through RSS or being able 
					to write articles on a wiki or individual document on Google Docs, the transferral 
					between communications heightened with AOL messenger being the sole 
					proprietorship of mentioned activities at the time.
					<br><br><br>
					With the way Web 3.0 will evolve our ability to communicate at a private and 
					decentralized level, these applications that have been covered in terms of its history and 
					capabilities will be viewed and controlled with the individual being the central office, 
					therefore developing a network of peers that do not need to necessarily ask for 
					permission to find their data but view it under their own terms, especially when making 
					transactions which we’ve covered in the workshop series ‘How to Make Use of a 
					Blockchain Wallet’. Throughout later workshops, what these applications are and how 
					they’ll shape our ability to use our infromation in a decentralized space will be covered 
					within our ‘Applications on the Blockchain’ series, which began as of three weeks ago.
