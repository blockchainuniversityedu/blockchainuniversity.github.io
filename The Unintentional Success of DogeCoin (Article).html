				<h1> The Unintentional Success Of </h1>
				<h3> DogeCoin </h3>
				<br>
                  <p>
					<i>"Cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem."</i>
					<br>
					- Jackson Palmer, <b><i>Creator of DogeCoin</i></b>
					<br><br><br>
                    As cryptocurrency has always remained the epicenter of all blockchain-based activities since 
					the beginning, it can also be perceived differently depending on whom you ask. Developers may 
					say that it’s the ultimate way to drive application-based networking across the globe, whereas 
					an average person may believe that it’s all just a farce hidden within digital code. If you were to 
					mix both communities together with the alignment of opinions and knowledge, you’d realize that 
					sometimes both can interconnect to accidentally create something monumental.
					<br><br><br>
                    In this article, we are covering the general movement of one of the most extensive alternative 
					coins in existence, which is DogeCoin. Some of you that are reading this either subtly heard 
					about this currency within the media, while others may already assume what the currency is 
					based on the meme that the token itself is based on, which is the 'Doge' meme.
                    <br><br><br>
                    After a photo was taken in the apartment of a Japanese blogger by the name of Atsuko Soto in 
					February 2010 of a Shiba Inu dog by the name of Kabosu, this quickly led to the popularity of 
					what is known today as a ‘meme’, an indirect art form that can be shared with others and related 
					to without needing to have specific context of the subject at hand at necessity. Since cultures 
					sometimes combine, particularly during unforeseen moments in internet history, the picture itself 
					was conceptualized shortly after its rise in popularization during 2013, establishing itself as 
					DogeCoin.
                    <br><br><br>
                    This coin, in particular, was simply a fork of Bitcoin, where two software engineers from 
					separate companies, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, came together based on a quick 
					conversation that took place on X (formerly known as X), joking about the idea of creating such 
					a project. Although it began as a moment of internet humor, the conversations about the 
					potential project turned it into an existing currency, which today values up to a market 
					capitalization of 10 billion$.
                    <br><br><br>
					With the initial supply initiated by Markus to be 100 billion tokens, cryptocurrency miners from 
					across the world embraced the rising popularity of the currency while also maintaining caution 
					over its potential disadvantages at the same time. Keep in mind, this currency is only based on a 
					‘meme’, which makes it instantly an altcoin since there is no particular asset behind it, it solely 
					relies on how much people discuss it and whether or not it’s positive or negative.
                    <br><br><br>
                    If it’s positive, usually the positive uprise in demand surpasses what’s being negatively 
					discussed, yet the risk is equally detrimental when a particular person, especially with that of a 
					major reputation, ties in their entire commentary on the currency more than everyone else. 
					Before I generally expand upon this, it’s essential that I cover the major gaps in the history of 
					this currency. As it’s generally meant to not take itself seriously, it still remains as a financial 
					powerhouse for early investors and mining pioneers of the network, though not so much for late 
					contributors that have only found out about DogeCoin as of now or a few years ago.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Generally speaking, in the world of cryptocurrency, the cheap route to take when it comes to 
					being involved with currency, especially regarding the purchase of tokens is that you may either 
					mine the currency with a base level of equipment that sources appropriate computing power, or 
					you purchase a specific part of the coin itself. Taking the mining route does indeed benefit those 
					who want to be rewarded for generating new blocks within the chain, yet, unironically the 
					intention was to create the altcoin that would exactly do that.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Before the introduction of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), the sole reason as 
					to why PoS (Proof of Stake) became the next best solution to solving excessive energy use 
					within blockchain networks, the PoW (Proof of Work) mechanism was enough to drive the early 
					uses of mining at the time when Bitcoin was still a relatively new concept amongst those just 
					entering the financial world. Needless to say, there is a bar of entry, not necessarily for those 
					who made early investments, but surely for those seeking to profit off of something with an 
					incredibly high risk of losing value in an instant.
                    <br><br><br>
					This general principle of risk and reward imbalance happening within a randomly generated 
					currency is called the low volatility anomaly. In this particular case, a currency that is unlikely to 
					change unpredictably on a large scale over time will likely give greater returns, hence why 
					stablecoins generally do better than altcoins for this reason alone. Of course, since this is 
					loosely based on the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that the prices of shared 
					assets within a market are reflective of all information relating to it or other products in the long 
					run.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Now, the important aspect of this is that the merged instance of DogeCoin between finance and 
					popular internet culture is not the only indirect combination that happens on the internet, since 
					other related aspects of the financial sector such as stocks, which are codependent on demand 
					and word of mouth at the time since they directly are affected by the performance of companies. 
					This adds to the financial movement behind DogeCoin, since all the money that is invested into 
					its market supply gets circulated beneath other corresponding elements of the market as well, 
					which adds to the efficient market hypothesis already.
                    <br><br><br>
					As the cycle of alternative coin prices is incredibly volatile under these regulations, the next 
					examples I’ll be mentioning relate to how community collaboration applies to the dictation of 
					these tokenized values, which is guaranteed not to be on the developer's side. Because market 
					timing is a major part of making investments with high returns, the predictions of DogeCoin can 
					be made directly yet indirectly from those largely influencing its changes, at which in this case 
					the most powerful and only driver is social media.
					<br><br><br>
					In this particular situation, the person who was most responsible for DogeCoin, especially after 
					the absence it was given by its developers in the year 2015, especially with the lack of updates 
					put onto the currency itself, was the co-founder of Tesla Elon Musk. Seeing the currency as a 
					vantage point, he was the first billionaire in the world to ever give unprecedented attention to it 
					and was doing so by speaking about it on Twitter.
					<br><br><br>
					This is also a major example of how decentralized currency has a central role in the control of its 
					demand, which is influenced by the Web 2.0 applications such as Twitter, creating a collision 
					between two worlds at which some aspects of control are still idealized. By speaking about the 
					currency with his millions of followers, the major impact of the currency itself just from one 
					person was already affecting those who were investing in the tokens early-on, creating a ripple 
					effect in the measured volatility at the time.
					<br><br><br>
					As time went on, Elon Musk slowly became what the internet coined as ‘The DogeFather,’ which 
					would only fulfill the opposite intentions of the coin's valued control, making it more central to the 
					voice of one influence rather than that of the combined community. Other instances only made 
					this more powerful, such as the fact that there was a declared ‘DogeDay’ on Twitter that would 
					take place on November 2nd, making up a bigger hike in its value, followed by shorter market 
					crashes right after. There was also a major example of Musk himself being held for $258 billion 
					in damages, as his acts included making references to the coin itself during an SNL skit, as well 
					as changing the entire button icon of the newly purchased X (formerly Twitter) website, for which 
					about 31% of the site's users had noticed at the time.
					<br><br><br>
					Once again, going from talking about a Web 3.0 generated product within a Web 2.0 social 
					media platform, in this particular situation, control was established due to its demand-fueled 
					nature, at which other aspects of that very same platform and its references to the application 
					only further prove control over its valuation.
					<br><br><br>
					Referring back to how one alternative to earning DogeCoin instead of buying it for large 
					expenses is mining it, relates also back to the market volatility position it holds, especially under 
					the low volatility anomaly principle. In this case, when an average crypto miner is rewarded for 
					helping to generate a new block within the network, there also takes place a secret transferral in 
					the currency itself which can all of a sudden generate profits.
					<br><br><br>
					This method relies on the mechanism behind crypto mining itself, which is using computing 
					power to solve mathematical problems identified under the Scrypt algorithm, which similar to the 
					SHA-256 algorithm that Bitcoin uses, rewards the corresponding currency’s tokens when the 
					equation is solved with the right computing power, though is also held in common with Litecoin. 
					In this case, when there is lower volatility within DogeCoin market movements for higher 
					returns, the miner tries to seek these token rewards yet can instantly switch to Litecoin using the 
					exact same algorithm if the risk is lower than the return compared to the previous coin itself, 
					hence creating transparency in quick transferability based on the code behind the network itself.
					<br><br><br>
					If there was a cyclical way of explaining it without over-emphasizing on the financial terminology, 
					currency volatility is split between two cycles, the ‘Flywheel Up’ cycle and the ‘Flywheel Down’ 
					cycle. In this case, especially for crypto miners, the price of Bitcoin may go up, urging more 
					people to buy it in the instant which defines the upward trend of the market, yet the opposite 
					being the ‘Flywheel Down’ principle, is that the price drops suddenly urging people to sell large 
					quantities of it. This is why making correct predictions between either cycle is important, 
					otherwise, the likelihood of significant losses taking place turns more into a gambling activity 
					than that of a reasonable investment itself.
					<br><br><br>
					However, this only increases with the unlimited supply that the coin itself holds, yet only 
					widening the gap for a lower barrier of entry, yet increased volatility since more people are 
					risking finances during this cyclical period of buying high and selling low, something that’s 
					practiced in popularity within general finance. Despite these concurrent pricing activities 
					happening simultaneously, the currency did still manage to become a major investment 
					eye-opener in 2018 when, three years after the coin's absence by the developers, it reached a 
					new market capitalization of 2 billion$.
					<br><br><br>
					The only currency ever having reached such a value, it has made positive impacts from years 
					before to keep up its relatively wholesome image, these examples being their fundraising 
					towards a Jamaican bobsledding team as part of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which went 
					up to a maximum of 30,000$ USD at the time. Companies have also come to accept it as a 
					payment currency, such as the cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. allowing people 
					to spend the currency towards digital gift cards, as well as its payment method being popular 
					within Tesla itself to no surprise.
					<br><br><br>
					The word ‘doge’, in of itself, originated from the cartoon series Homestar Runner, which had 
					already birthed the popular culture from the beginning, creating a shared community that is only 
					held liable for its popularity and nothing more to it. In addition to all of this, DogeCoin had also 
					adopted the nature of ‘tipping’, which is essentially rewarding DogeCoin to people who 
					particularly do a specific favor. This can be thought similarly with airdrops when free currency is 
					earned for performing a particular task.
					<br><br><br>
					With the general culture of ‘tipping’, not entirely connected to the extensive payments a waitress 
					receives during her shift, instances have taken place where NASCAR in of itself has been 
					offered the currency in exchange for the meme-inspired car itself, which was largely promoted 
					on the very platform that it was valued with to begin with, this being X. As can be seen, demand 
					trickles into every part of culture where the word ‘influencer’ is also involved, making the cycle of 
					investing profits and losses always coincide with the digital interactions that drive the flow of the 
					token's brand to begin with.
					<br><br><br>
					Overall, it’s fair to say that this particular alternative coin, amongst millions of others, has held 
					more of a cultural impact on the blockchain rather than a financial meritable one, only driving the 
					conclusion that we’ll be expecting more unexpected combinations of finance and almost 
					unrelated internet conversations for the future, which can simply fall under the hood of the 
					ongoing spur in collaboration that the application-based network holds to this day.
