    <h1> The Incredible History Of: </h1>
    <h3> Cryptocurrency Mining </h3>
    <br>
      <p>
        <br><br><br>
        The meticulous insertion of cryptocurrency mining had already evolved into something 
        revolutionary by the time Satoshi Nakamoto had developed the network under a sophisticated 
        combination of mathematical algorithms, therefore creating an economy on not just only owners 
        in a stake of cryptocurrency, but also gaining an influence of people who were willing to above 
        and beyond that.


        <br><br><br>
        Creating a connection between finances, and asset management of digital property to a 
        decentralized world that wasn’t overlooked by a major organization was the next step, especially 
        for developers who owned an estate in servers and GPUs, to make use of the act of mining 
        something in the scene of cryptocurrency.


        <br><br><br>
        In our modern day, it’s safe to say that there are a multitude of applications such as 
        mining software, developed by third-party sources, that drive the momentum of crypto mining. There 
        are a lot of them to mention, but for now, the core focus is on the well known ones such as Hut 
        8, Marathon Digital, or even Riot Blockchain.


        <br><br><br>
        In order to understand how crypto mining works, it’s essential to get an idea of what is required 
        to make it all take place to begin with. To mine cryptocurrency, you need a sufficient use of 
        energy and power, and in addition to that requirement, a hardware GPU capable of running the 
        interface needed to run the code that will solve the algorithm once a Proof-Of-Work process has 
        taken place, an SSD that will speed up the process of storing and processing the data, and as 
        the key part of the process, something called an ASIC or application-specific integrated circuit.


        <br><br><br>
        Since the person reading this already fit most of the requirements, I will get into the discussion 
        of what ASIC mining technology is for, but before that will try to emphasize on how transactions 
        are processed to begin with on the network.


        <br><br><br>
        Like every technology in computing, there is an input and an output, which in this case comes to 
        the transactions and the amount that is transferred between what goes in and out of the 
        machine. Of course, due to a coding defect or mishaps in security, cryptocurrency does not 
        function like traditional currency, it is based on the premise of being fully virtual, at which unless 
        without confirmation there is no reversibility of the finances since an organization like a bank is 
        not overlooking what is happening.


        <br><br><br>
        So in this case, you’re working to mine a random supply of coins verified by either a random 
        chain of people through a Proof of Work mechanism, or by the Proof of Stake method. With 
        various technologic elements included, such as the time and speed of the ongoing transaction, 
        the power of this concept relies on the use of internet, the only element of the decentralized 
        network at which an organization has some kind of power. Mining currency unlike putting your 
        money into, acts as the reward system of the technology.
        <br><br><br>
        With the use of a particular algorithm that works under the process, called the SHA-256 hash 
        algorithm, this helps to drive a process at which a 256-bit number generated by the user once a 
        transaction has gone through takes place. Like all verification processes, there is a chain with a 
        genesis block that takes place to help all of the validation of data run through smoothly 
        dependant on the WiFi speeds and so on.
        <br><br><br>
        All of these processes together, help to make sure the crypto miner is able to solve 
        mathematical problems that will in turn help them to retain a certain level of currency ranging 
        anywhere from Bitcoin to Ethereum, which is almost like mining stocks. Whatever you receive 
        still fluctuates or goes down in value depending on whether or not it’s an altcoin or stable coin 
        that you’re mining, the mathematical problems set in place that will reward you with them are 
        built under the magnitude of the SHA-256 algorithm, at which anyone who is able to find a 
        particular hash value within the network is instantly rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process 
        of finding a hash value within the algorithm makes it so that once it’s found through rounds of 
        inputting the data of a particular user by converting it to a binary (1s and 0s), chunking the data 
        into bytes of information, and then creating a loop of a final values that will ultimately help to 
        secure the string of numbers that will remain fixed in its amount of digits regardless of how 
        many times it changes over the course of the transactions that take place.
        <br><br><br>
        Keep in mind that, I am only speaking of Bitcoin, as other currencies such as Ethereum apply to 
        different hashing algorithms such as Ethash, with various more belonging to different algorithms.
        <br><br><br>
        Altogether, you are finalizing a network of validation to complete towards the search for a hash 
        value that will secure the next block in the algorithm, verifying and opening up new nodes for 
        users to take their currency, and to ultimately reward the user in return. Now that you have a 
        basic idea of what the process of crypto mining looks like, at which you’ve likely also realized 
        that costs aside, the reward is designed for expanding a network by contributing your own 
        personal power, the particular machine involved in this case being the ASIC is specifically 
        involved in helping to drive this power.
        <br><br><br>
        Application-specific integrated circuits, are a more expensive technology used in mining 
        cryptocurrency, that differs from the use of GPUs when performing the same task. To simply put, 
        it consumes a lot more energy and is specifically focused towards mining Bitcoin or Litecoin. In 
        case you haven’t heard of Litecoin after watching my previous workshop on the historical 
        timeline of Ethereum, it is specifically a fork of Bitcoin, or an altcoin like its predecessor that has 
        a differing value but works in about the same way in terms of use of power.
        <br><br><br>
        Under today's conditions, you do not need an ASIC machine to mine cryptocurrency, as a GPU 
        is already the cheaper option that comes with your desktop, that can enable such a procedure 
        to exist. But it is important to mention the technology that goes behind this process, as there’s 
        another step to this mining process, which is protecting against security. In a previous workshop, 
        I went over how there’s risk in cybersecurity behind any blockchain-related process, as the use 
        of ISPs that aren’t on the network immediately open up vulnerabilities, at which the 
        mining-specific issue is something called cryptojacking or timejacking.
        <br><br><br>
        All of the transactions recorded by each separate hash identifier within the algorithm, creates a 
        particular tree of input and output in data facilitated by these varying algorithms called a Merkle tree. 
        Ever wondered why the network itself looks like one big tree without a particular root taking 
        place? That’s exactly what a Merkle tree is, it’s essentially an infrastructure that streamlines the 
        confirmation process of transactions from within each block, ultimately creating arrays of 
        records within parallel networks, leveraging Bitcoin miners to use software-specific solutions 
        that will help to mine the currency through third-party sources built initially on the platform, to 
        collectively drive integrity and security for those rewarding from the process.
        <br><br><br>
        Now that this has been mentioned, the Merkle tree falls to the risk of cryptojacking, at which the 
        hacker tries to purposely introduce malware such as Trojan viruses into already existing code 
        repositories on the network, implementing packages that target developers that have working 
        programs within the decentralized cloud, ultimately creating a ripple effect in a network that uses 
        unauthorizing crypto mining resources, allowing the hacker to extract any information they can 
        to later use it to for malicious purposes such as power use and of course mined cryptocurrency.
        <br><br><br>
        To simply put, the hacker is disrupting the code within the network, and ultimately demonstrating 
        an attack that causes a wind of pay loads towards their hash numbers once the data is 
        extracted, something powerful that can be exploited as long it’s spotted by the developer. Since 
        a lot of crimes in this generation of developing Web 3.0 activities go untraced, there are quite 
        some examples out there that have been spotted. Some are companies such as Sophos, which 
        are responsible for employing a serves called VMWare Horizon, a virtual machine product that 
        helps one to work between multiple clouds for their own business, found that cryptojackers had 
        infiltrated their databases under their Lunix-based system infrastructure, by using a particular 
        software called XMRig, notable as being a piece of software unlike the kinds of I’ve mentioned 
        before that is used specifically for security intrusions. It was ruled that this was for typical 
        reasons that a hacker would want to disrupt the process of crypto mining for, which is for 
        thieving computing power from companies, and also using their own technology to potentially 
        earn their currency through the use that energy or mining data.
        <br><br><br>
        As you can see, there is a balance between what mining software is used for the SHA-256 
        algorithm, and the kind used to develop malware under those same systems. Altogether, the 
        major conclusion to make here regarding crypto mining is that, there has never been a more 
        collaborative way for people around the world to be rewarded for opening paths that a 
        decentralized network needs. Through contribution, crypto miners are capable of opening new 
        blocks for users to join in on, not only proving that governance exists through Proof-of-Stake 
        mechanisms in the network through the ownership of cryptocurrency either purchased or mined 
        to expand security and power efficiency, but also shows that a reward is given for it for those 
        who allow such consensus mechanisms to take place when generating new blocks for the new 
        set of users that will eventually come along the network.

            Keep in mind that, I am only speaking of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Bitcoin: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, utilizing the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Bitcoin</span>, as other currencies such as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Ethereum: A popular cryptocurrency employing the Ethash hashing algorithm for mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Ethereum</span> apply to different <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hashing algorithms: Mathematical functions used in cryptocurrency mining to secure transactions and create unique identifiers." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hashing algorithms</span> such as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Ethash: A hashing algorithm used in Ethereum mining, differing from the SHA-256 algorithm used in Bitcoin mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Ethash</span>, with various more belonging to different algorithms.

            Altogether, you are finalizing a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Network of validation: A system or process aimed at confirming and validating transactions within a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">network of validation</span> to complete towards the search for a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hash value: A unique string of characters generated from input data by a cryptographic hash function." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hash value</span> that will secure the next block in the algorithm, verifying and opening up new <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Nodes for users: Access points or locations within a network where users can access or interact with the blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">nodes for users</span> to take their currency, and to ultimately <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Reward for the user: The incentive provided to miners or validators for their contributions in maintaining the blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">reward the user</span> in return. Now that you have a basic idea of what the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Process of crypto mining: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">process of crypto mining</span> looks like, at which you’ve likely also realized that costs aside, the reward is designed for expanding a network by contributing your own <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Personal power: The computational power or resources contributed by an individual miner to the blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">personal power</span>, the particular machine involved in this case being the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit designed specifically for crypto mining tasks, enhancing efficiency." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ASIC</span> is specifically involved in helping to drive this <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Driving power: The capability of the ASIC machine to contribute significant computational power to the mining process." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">power</span>.

            <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Application-specific integrated circuits: Specialized hardware designed for specific tasks, particularly used in cryptocurrency mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Application-specific integrated circuits</span>, are a more expensive technology used in <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Mining cryptocurrency: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">mining cryptocurrency</span>, that differs from the use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="GPUs: Graphics Processing Units, commonly used in cryptocurrency mining operations." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">GPUs</span> when performing the same task. To simply put, it consumes a lot more energy and is specifically focused towards mining <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Bitcoin: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, mined using specialized hardware like ASICs." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Bitcoin</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Litecoin: A cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin but with different algorithms and faster block generation times." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Litecoin</span>.

            Under today's conditions, you do not need an <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ASIC machine: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit designed specifically for crypto mining tasks, enhancing efficiency." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ASIC machine</span> to mine cryptocurrency, as a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="GPU: Graphics Processing Unit, capable of performing computations necessary for cryptocurrency mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">GPU</span> is already the cheaper option that comes with your desktop, that can enable such a procedure to exist. But it is important to mention the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Technology behind the process: The tools, software, and algorithms utilized in cryptocurrency mining operations." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">technology behind this process</span>, as there’s another step to this mining process, which is <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Protecting against security: Implementing measures to safeguard cryptocurrency mining operations from cyber threats and vulnerabilities." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">protecting against security</span>. In a previous workshop, I went over how there’s risk in <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Cybersecurity: The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks or unauthorized access." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">cybersecurity</span> behind any <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Blockchain-related process: Operations or activities conducted within a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">blockchain-related process</span>, as the use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ISPs: Internet Service Providers, entities providing internet access to users." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ISPs</span> that aren’t on the network immediately open up <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses or loopholes in systems that can be exploited by attackers." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">vulnerabilities</span>, at which the mining-specific issue is something called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Cryptojacking: Unauthorized use of a device's resources to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner's consent." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">cryptojacking</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Timejacking: Exploiting the timestamping system in a blockchain to manipulate time-related functions." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">timejacking</span>.

            All of the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Transactions recorded: Process of documenting and storing data related to exchanges or transfers within a blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">transactions recorded</span> by each separate <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hash identifier: A unique string of characters generated from input data by a cryptographic hash function." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hash identifier</span> within the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Algorithm: A set of rules or instructions used in cryptocurrency systems to perform specific tasks." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">algorithm</span>, creates a particular tree of input and output in data facilitated by these varying algorithms called a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Merkle tree: A data structure in cryptography used to efficiently verify the integrity of data within a block by creating a hierarchical structure of hashes." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Merkle tree</span>. Ever wondered why the network itself looks like one big tree without a particular root taking place? That’s exactly what a Merkle tree is, it’s essentially an infrastructure that streamlines the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Confirmation process: The process of validating and confirming the accuracy of transactions within a blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">confirmation process</span> of transactions from within each <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Blocks: Segments of data in a blockchain containing multiple transactions." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">block</span>, ultimately creating <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Arrays of records: Collections of data or information organized in a specific structure within a blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">arrays of records</span> within <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Parallel networks: Multiple interconnected networks running simultaneously." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">parallel networks</span>, leveraging <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Bitcoin miners: Individuals or entities validating transactions and adding them to the Bitcoin blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Bitcoin miners</span> to use <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Software-specific solutions: Tailored software applications designed for mining cryptocurrency." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">software-specific solutions</span> that will help to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Mining the currency: The process of generating new cryptocurrency coins through mining operations." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">mine the currency</span> through third-party sources built initially on the platform, to collectively drive <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Integrity and security: Ensuring the authenticity and safety of data within a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">integrity and security</span> for those rewarding from the process.

            Now that this has been mentioned, the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Merkle tree: A data structure in cryptography used to efficiently verify the integrity of data within a block by creating a hierarchical structure of hashes." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Merkle tree</span> falls to the risk of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Cryptojacking: Unauthorized use of a device's resources to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner's consent." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">cryptojacking</span>, at which the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hacker: An individual or group attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems for malicious purposes." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hacker</span> tries to purposely introduce <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Malware: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">malware</span> such as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Trojan viruses: Malicious software that disguises itself as legitimate software, allowing unauthorized access to the user's system." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Trojan viruses</span> into already existing <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Code repositories: Storage spaces for version control systems containing code and related data." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">code repositories</span> on the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Network: A system of interconnected computers or devices." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">network</span>, implementing packages that target developers that have working programs within the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Decentralized cloud: A decentralized network of computing resources and services." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">decentralized cloud</span>, ultimately creating a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Ripple effect: The spread or repercussion of an event or action throughout a network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ripple effect</span> in a network that uses unauthorizing crypto mining resources, allowing the hacker to extract any information they can to later use it for <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Malicious purposes: Harmful or destructive intentions, often related to cybersecurity breaches." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">malicious purposes</span> such as power use and of course mined cryptocurrency.
        </p>

        <p>
            To simply put, the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hacker: An individual or group attempting to gain unauthorized access to systems for malicious purposes." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hacker</span> is disrupting the code within the network, and ultimately demonstrating an <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Attack: Malicious actions or attempts to compromise a system or network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">attack</span> that causes a wind of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Payloads: Malicious data or instructions within a network payload." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">payloads</span> towards their <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Hash numbers: Unique identifiers generated from data within a cryptographic hash function." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">hash numbers</span> once the data is extracted, something powerful that can be exploited as long it’s spotted by the developer. Since a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Crimes: Illegal activities or actions violating laws or regulations." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">crimes</span> in this generation of developing <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Web 3.0 activities: Next-generation web-related developments focusing on decentralized technologies." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Web 3.0 activities</span> go untraced, there are quite some examples out there that have been spotted. Some are companies such as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Sophos: A company specializing in cybersecurity solutions." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Sophos</span>, which are responsible for employing a serves called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="VMWare Horizon: A virtual machine product facilitating cloud operations for businesses." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">VMWare Horizon</span>, a virtual machine product that helps one to work between multiple clouds for their own business, found that <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Cryptojackers: Individuals or groups involved in unauthorized cryptocurrency mining activities." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">cryptojackers</span> had infiltrated their databases under their <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Linux-based system infrastructure: Systems or networks operating using the Linux operating system." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Linux-based system infrastructure</span>, by using a particular software called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="XMRig: Cryptocurrency mining software known for its association with unauthorized mining activities." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">XMRig</span>, notable as being a piece of software unlike the kinds of I’ve mentioned before that is used specifically for <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Security intrusions: Unauthorized access or compromise of system security." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">security intrusions</span>. It was ruled that this was for typical reasons that a hacker would want to disrupt the process of crypto mining for, which is for <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Thieving computing power: Unauthorized use of computational resources for mining without permission." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">thieving computing power</span> from companies, and also using their own technology to potentially earn their <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Currency: Digital or virtual money used in cryptocurrency transactions." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">currency</span> through the use that energy or mining data.
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, there is a balance between what <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Mining software: Software used to mine cryptocurrencies through various algorithms." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">mining software</span> is used for the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="SHA-256 algorithm: Cryptographic algorithm used in Bitcoin mining." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">SHA-256 algorithm</span>, and the kind used to develop <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Malware development: Creating malicious software designed to disrupt or damage systems." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">malware</span> under those same systems. Altogether, the major conclusion to make here regarding <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Crypto mining: Process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">crypto mining</span> is that, there has never been a more collaborative way for people around the world to be rewarded for opening paths that a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Decentralized network: A network where no single entity or authority has control over the system." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">decentralized network</span> needs. Through contribution, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Crypto miners: Individuals or entities validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">crypto miners</span> are capable of opening new <span class="tooltip" data-definition="New blocks: Newly created segments of data on a blockchain containing multiple transactions." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">blocks</span> for users to join in on, not only proving that governance exists through <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Proof-of-Stake mechanisms: Consensus algorithms based on participants' stake in a cryptocurrency." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Proof-of-Stake mechanisms</span> in the network through the ownership of cryptocurrency either purchased or mined to expand security and power efficiency, but also shows that a reward is given for it for those who allow such <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Consensus mechanisms: Processes used to achieve agreement in a decentralized network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">consensus mechanisms</span> to take place when generating new blocks for the new set of users that will eventually come along the network.
