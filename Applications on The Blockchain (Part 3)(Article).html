				<h2> In-Depth Explanation </h2>
				</center>
          <p>
          Since anything ranging from software to other applications tends to raise security vulnerabilities, thanks to its reliance on a particular network (especially on the blockchain), it is essential to note the core reason as to why such a thing will always take place. As communities evolve around a particular project, the intentions of the people involved in that community can range from simply discussing the digital product to actually developing or even exploiting whatever was initially created from the developer to begin with. In this case, we will be discussing one particular kind of person that aims for exploiting vulnerabilities of such an application and how they aim to take advantage of this weakness to their own benefit. That individual is called the hacker. Now, since hacking is a broad term that can range from solving difficult problems that put a project at risk of working to potentially altering and even defecting essential code for a product, we will be discussing the more negative side of the spectrum as it complicates the blockchain, in particular, to quite an extent.
					<br><br><br>
          Though, since we have already discussed hacks that are common in the blockchain in past workshops, and will do so in the near future, the particular kind we will be discussing is aimed back at the identity of the person on the network. As apps are consistently being released in the Web 2.0 space, aiming to promise identity protection, such developments are taking place on the blockchain as well. In this case, we will be discussing a digital product called Civic.
					<br><br><br>
          As mentioned before, since communities tend to thrive on solving complex issues separately by enforcing their own projects and solutions, Civic tries to do the same with identity protection, by providing a structural ecosystem at which identity fraud can be combatted via a relatively known feature of the blockchain called DIDs, which stand for Decentralized Identifiers. Decentralized identifiers serve the main purpose of managing significant users on the blockchain by assigning a particular input of data to a person that is held to their private rights and can be done so on an institutional level on behalf of industries ranging from healthcare to governmental services.     
					<br><br><br>
          If there was a more direct way of defining it, you are given a digital passport that holds inputs of data that clarify such details such as your name or public record history of anything relating to the application, under the once-again mentioned DID. But, past this, the information that is given an input to the digital passport is put under a specific name called VCs, which stand for verifiable credentials. VCs are the input of data mentioned earlier, or more so the contents of the digital passport. It is the digital way at which a particular ID is specifically held by the node of that network, which can be managed thanks to modern hardware advantages of the blockchain networks. By modern hardware advantages, we specifically mean cold and hot storages, where you can either choose to access your own private data online or offline. One of the core reasons as to why this is especially important is because hackers have an even more difficult time finding exploits in something when verifiability is held at a higher priority. Apps, in general, tend to do so in the Web 2.0 space as well, by sourcing resources such as two-factor authentication, so that the hackers will have to hack through multiple firewalls to get through a person's account.
          <br><br><br>
          In addition to VCs and their association with DIDs, another key aspect of this self-identification ecosystem provided by Civic is that cryptographic keys are assigned to help convert the digital input of private information into a series of numbers that cannot be easily deciphered. The term ‘crypto’ comes from the term cryptography because the security aspect involves taking code in particular and translating it into something that cannot be read by an average human. Without both the ecosystem and the wonders of cryptography, simply securing any sort of data on a network would be far more difficult, giving a lesser important meaning to the word ‘blockchain’.
					<br><br><br>
          Since this article will include a lot of terminology, keep in mind that a lot of it can be easily understood as the application, in particular, we are discussing is made up of rather simplistic counterparts. The specific information that we want to discuss next depends on what it is and how it’s used for the intended purpose. For example, when you are visiting your local doctor, they will obviously hold a record of medical information to keep track of everything and make sure further issues will not appear. There is a specific application we will discuss in the next part of this series, which provides a way to handle medical records, but since we are discussing identity protection, its contents mentioned regarding the input of data will be connected to features of an average person such as name, birthdate, and occupation.
          <br><br><br>
          Now, in case you haven’t quite heard of identity theft before, it’s as the term implies. You are taking the personal information of someone else and using it for malicious purposes that could relate to taking ownership of something you have, such as property, a very common problem that also exists on the blockchain when it comes to digital assets. Since more than ever, the emergence of owning something on a network independent of the owner is increasingly strengthening as more people join the blockchain, the term used in this case when it comes to Civic for personal information is called PII, which stands for personally identifiable information.
					<br><br><br>
          As mentioned before, it is held under this name because it is of one’s personal identity, but it’s also meant to be facilitated and monitored under a cryptographic fashion, thanks to the general idea of private keys. That’s where the ‘personal’ aspect of the word term PII comes in, as cryptography allows for specific encoding to take place on behalf of contributed computing power, where the key itself takes the VCs of a person and allows it to be stored into a DID. Every hacker's major weakness on a network is that the exploit they try to find is hidden or non-existent within an application that has numerous layers built into it. Layers of an average blockchain will be discussed further, but in this case, without creating an almost onion-style structure to an application, everything would be held insecurely among masses that primarily consist partially of hackers themselves.
          <br><br><br>
          So now that we’ve covered how existing information is taken, packaged, and distributed through a secure ecosystem, we should get into how this is all displayed on an actual application. When you think of an application, you consider it to be something on your phone like a program would be on your computer. It consists of a user interface where each button serves a purpose to get to why you downloaded it in the first place. In such a case, we call these programs system images. As the term suggests, you are combining all sorts of code together to be communicating in a particular program. But, it does not necessarily stop there, as there is a process that additionally takes place when it comes to the Civic app, which is called SSIs. As nodes do exist on the blockchain, SSIs allow something called data migration to take place, at which you are using the application to pass your data through an IOTA method that allows you to validate your personal information and to engage in exchanges that happen on the blockchain. For example, you could be purchasing a piece of art from someone at the promise of paying them something such as a certain amount of tokens. In this case, Civic will use an SSI, which stands for a single system image, in order to migrate your digital passport with the nodes that you are interacting with on the blockchain. It’s like passing through a border and communicating with the patrol that you are an incoming citizen that has the right credentials to pass through into the territory, and to make any contributions within that center of land that involves buying and selling things. An SSI is the application that also acts as the analogy mentioned earlier with the border patrol; you are making sure that your VCs are not leaked in the middle of a simple transaction. Since we are discussing nodes, it is important to admit that this indeed does make activity on the blockchain much more efficient. As proof of stake has been mentioned many times before, this is almost similar, but instead of receiving airdrops for a token that secures you in the node of a network, you are allowing an independent ecosystem of SSIs to do it for you instead.
          <br><br><br>
          Now, keep in mind that we will not be forgetting what smart contracts are in this situation, as they are the one reason why you can even buy or sell things on the blockchain to begin with. And with any smart contract, we are also met with the idea of sourcing information from one place to another, like sending an email, except everything is divided between containers of data that don’t connect to anything central. This is where examples of applications come in, like Civic, which aid in protecting identities but under additional requirements. One example is the Shyft app, which gives any user on the network a chance to transfer data as part of a piece of their identity that doesn’t necessarily have to do with what was mentioned before, such as name, birthdate, or occupation. In this case, instead of these three factors or more, Shyft verifies a person's eligibility to exchange information through something called a credibility score. In this instance, the ‘credibility score’ is one way of measurement that indicates how trustworthy someone is on the blockchain, especially when it comes to doing business. But, how does such a measurement take place? Well, similar to Civic, there is an ecosystem on its own for this application in particular, at which two things take place, one being a protocol and another a system that procedurally builds the identifies the credibility of someone under that protocol. Shyft uses a specific protocol called Veriscope, which makes use of a process at which smart contracts are layered within the Ethereum network, similar to the ERC-20 protocol, amongst a set of registered identities on behalf of the user via a system called POA, or proof-of-authority. Compared to Civic, you are in this case, taking smart contracts and assigning them to a protocol that organizes their functions dependent upon a system that dictates which user has a stronger score of trustworthiness. It is one way of independently giving your personal information to an application that personalizes your identity in order to give stronger control over your information and its appeal to others. Appealing to a customer is mostly at the concern of the business itself; hence, this entire cycle is enforced by the application with a particular strain of blockchain technology called virtual asset service providers, which in short are named VASPs. 
          <br><br><br>
          Applications on blockchain networks are very independent in their own structures and developments; hence, VASPs are one alternate way of assigning a digital passport into the context of measuring trustworthiness to a particular user on the network. Now, it is important to mention that beyond businesses with assigned authoritative systems on the blockchain, the government is not exactly the loose end that should be forgotten in this case. All of these processes would not be possible without a policy established under the G7 that allows credible scores to take place for certain businesses, which in this case is the initiation of the FATF within the blockchain. FATF stands for Financial Action Task Force, a particular group that aims to trace and monitor any potential illegal activities that a business could be involved in, which is most commonly categorized between drug trafficking and money laundering. But of course, since this is an old policy established by the G7 summit in 1989, newer policies are being held under the government to further strengthen the monitoring of business information to avoid cybersecurity crimes, such as the Blockchain Task Force.
          <br><br><br>
          After explaining all of this, it is key to mention that there are lots of different ecosystems on the blockchain that are geared towards securing transactions belonging to various interest groups on the blockchain. Some, like Shyft, are for businesses, others are for identity protection, but there are additional ones that are involved in video games as well. The topic of video games, or GameFi, in the world of blockchain will be explained further in these workshops, but in this case, we will boil our next example down to another key application that aims to follow through the same style of identification security via Ethereum.
          <br><br><br>
          As with any transaction, since addresses under a protocol within the blockchain are the ultimate link that allows cryptography to meet the general dynamic of smart contracts, one app in particular that takes this to a new level is the Enjin platform. The core purpose of the Enjin platform is to avoid security intrusions from taking place by developing a system that focuses on making sure that one address firmly agrees on a transaction to another once a confirmation is given as to whether or not something has been signed. For example, if you are finding work somewhere, you may need to agree on a contract with rules and regulations depending on where you are working, especially if it’s something far more serious such as a government job. In this case, the Enjin platform emphasizes the same process but more so by turning the smart contract into the digital passport itself. In this case, the process works by making use of a hardware wallet called the ‘daemon wallet’. What does the term ‘daemon’ mean, you ask? Daemons are essentially just programs that run in the background without direct interaction; for example, your computer could be running something that monitors your hard drive space without you needing to know where it is until it interacts with you instead. Such a function works with a wallet as well, which acts as a daemon as it holds exchanged properties within a transaction between two addresses that act as either the buyer or seller in this case, until an agreement is made where both addresses are their own unique numbers and are not to be confused with anyone else on the network.
          <br><br><br>
          You’re likely wondering, why does there need to be a wallet that tries to act as the middleman of identity verification between two parties in a transaction? Well, one of the most common hacking problems in the blockchain is called the ‘race attack’. In the race attack, one hacker in particular could exhaust the blockchain by not directly confirming to another buyer or seller in the blockchain that they have the verifiable credentials that can allow a particular asset to pass through in exchange for, say, a token. So, in this case, if a person was offering $20 for a large pizza at a pizzeria, the equivalent in this case would be that the person somehow uses a false payment method to make it seem like they paid for the food when they haven’t, which is usually impossible in today's world of digital payments but is surely possible in the blockchain as it’s still developing. Hackers can do this in an average transaction, so to stop such an attack from taking place, the Enjin platform, which functions under the Enjin software, uses a wallet that runs in the background for additional confirmations between two Ethereum addresses to take place.
          <br><br><br>
          More about these ecosystems and their applicable nature will be explained in the future, but for now, with the power of Civic, diverging the morals and ethics of an average application that promises security to the person has become ever more convenient on the blockchain, though improvements must, of course, be made, especially on behalf of government services, in order to take data and strengthen it back to the person on the network.

      <h3> Blockchain & Identity Protection</h3>
      <br><br><br>
        <p>
            As we’ve previously covered various security vulnerabilities that take place within 
            <span class="tooltip" data-definition="blockchain networks" title="Blockchain Networks: Distributed digital ledgers">blockchain networks</span>, ranging from <span class="tooltip" data-definition="51% attacks" title="51% Attacks: When an entity or group controls the majority of a network's computing power">51% attacks</span> where hackers can assume governance 
            over the nodes of users within the network to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Sybil attacks" title="Sybil Attacks: When an attacker subverts the reputation system of a network by creating multiple identities">Sybil attacks</span> where fake identities can be 
            created in order to solicit invalid transactions, in this article we will narrow down the 
            subject into how various applications beyond the methods of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="two-factor authentication" title="Two-Factor Authentication: A security process that requires two methods of verification">two-factor authentication</span> 
            and making use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="cold storages" title="Cold Storages: Offline storage systems used for securing cryptocurrencies">cold storages</span> can cover safety in specific areas of the field most 
            importantly one being <span class="tooltip" data-definition="identity protection" title="Identity Protection: Measures to safeguard personal information and identity from theft or misuse">identity protection</span>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Since there is a lot to cover, we’ll be covering the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Civic application" title="Civic Application: A system creating ecosystems for identity protection">Civic application</span>, which is responsible 
            for creating diverse ecoysystems of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="identity fraud protection" title="Identity Fraud Protection: Measures to safeguard against fraudulent use of personal identity">identity fraud protection</span> by making use of 
            something called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)" title="DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers): A method for creating decentralized identity management">DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)</span> solely responsible for creating a 
            decentralized format for identities to be managed by significant users especially for the 
            long-term. The process of Civic involves having a friendly user interface for those to 
            control their own interactions which acts as data to be sustained under a specific 
            blockchain protocol, at which various public institutions that take place in the 
            government as well as health care can manage personal information with patients and 
            clients by getting a hold of a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="digital passport" title="Digital Passport: A digital identification document verifying a person's identity">digital passport</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Like any other means of verifying identity, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="digital passports" title="Digital Passports: Digital identification documents verifying a person's identity">digital passports</span> which work under <span class="tooltip" data-definition="VCs (Verifiable Credentials)" title="VCs (Verifiable Credentials): Digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified">VCs (Verifiable Credentials)</span> 
            function as a way to incorporate trust into those establishing 
            network connections within the blockchain mainframe with a particular ID that can 
            withhold the validation of such activity to prevent security intrusions against identity on 
            all ends of the spectrum. If you’ve read our article about making use of a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="blockchain wallet" title="Blockchain Wallet: A digital wallet used for storing cryptocurrencies and interacting with blockchain networks">blockchain wallet</span>, it can be carefully realized that the same way your identity can be protected 
            offline through cold storages, hot storages have an ever-developing solution that can 
            assist with reassuring careful management of resources by a specific identity, under 
            verifiable conditions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Second to having <span class="tooltip" data-definition="VCs supported by DIDs" title="VCs supported by DIDs: Verifiable Credentials supported by Decentralized Identifiers, facilitating secure verification of digital identities">VCs supported by DIDs</span>, another essential input that is given as a 
            responsibility amongst users themselves is having the skillset in managing 
            <span class="tooltip" data-definition="cryptographic keys" title="Cryptographic Keys: Unique codes used to secure digital data and authenticate users">cryptographic keys</span> that may allow them to access such as applications and platforms. In 
            simple terms, the connection to self-sovereignty over identifiable data usages by the 
            user is solely relied on <span class="tooltip" data-definition="PII (personally identifiable information)" title="PII (personally identifiable information): Information that identifies an individual, such as name, address, or SSN">PII (personally identifiable information)</span>. Since private keys thanks 
            to errors in application development and code defects within smart contracts are major 
            loopholes for hackers, as explained in detail in the article below this one, it must be 
            carefully admired that cryptographic keys must me made use of in order to sustain PII 
            over a long period of time. For a more detailed explanation, in special instances where a 
            <span class="tooltip" data-definition="short address attack" title="Short Address Attack: Attempt by hackers to invade a node or create a fake identity using an address shorter than the standard length">short address attack</span> takes place so that hackers may either try to invade a node or 
            create a fake identity at which their address is shorter than the 20-byte string of data it 
            usually takes over, cryptographic keys are an algorithmic encryption method assuring 
            that any string of data within a public or private address assigned to any set of users 
            cannot be altered manually and is to be purely randomized, especially when major 
            exchanges under <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ERC-20" title="ERC-20: Ethereum Request for Comment 20, a standard for implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain">ERC-20</span> take place (a standard that is generally used to help operate 
            smart contracts under Ethereum cryptocurrencies function).
        </p>        

        <p>
            Altogether, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Civic">Civic</span> alongside the helpful resources of these keys establish a way for users 
            to manage their <span class="tooltip" data-definition="PII (personally identifiable information) with VCs and DIDs" title="PII (personally identifiable information) with VCs and DIDs: Managing personally identifiable information with Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers">PII with VCs and DIDs</span> under a specific interface as a reliable application 
            for those seeking to make sure they’re not victims of common attacks. In addition to 
            this, relating back to the digital passport itself which is the be-all of identity protection 
            in any instance that doesn’t just take place within the blockchain, generally speaking, 
            digital held passport identities work under a system called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="SSI (Single system image)" title="SSI (Single system image): A system where a set of machines appear to function as a single system">SSI</span>. This simply stands for 
            ‘Single system image’, at which a large set of machines responsible for managing data 
            especially in the realm of digital assets, cryptograms, and currencies altogether appear 
            to be on one system which is what the passport itself partially represents. This 
            essentially helps with the process making sure nodes are balanced with migration, so 
            that certain progress such as exchanges can be saved or validified from one particular 
            node to another. As the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="IOTA (Internet of Things)">IOTA</span> method has been mentioned in our 
            previous article about cybersecurity, an average SSI system can have a major 
            contribution to this verification system, especially when there’s a high traffic of smart 
            contracts taking place within the network. Altogether, the digital passport is the most 
            important part of the cycle in making sure applications such as Civic can create a secure 
            platform similar to that of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="cold storages">cold storages</span> (a way to use a blockchain wallet offline to 
            manage financial data), in order to help any user manage their own data without major 
            organizations looking over it themselves.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Relating to the topic of trust, which is the sole reason why <span class="tooltip" data-definition="smart contracts under a blockchain format">smart contracts under a default blockchain format</span> exists, other applications also create reassurance for different branches of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="PII management">identity protection involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) management</span>. One of these is a platform by the name of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Shyft">Shyft</span>, which next to the private user, is personalized for major businesses that can utilize the application in sourcing their own data across a blockchain network with the use of a ‘credibility score’. This score relies on how much of their organization has not been detected for any kind of fraud under the verification process that the system puts the business through. Similar to Civic, Shyft works under a distinct established protocol by the name of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Veriscope">Veriscope</span> which functions by making use of smart contracts to create a layer within the Ethereum network of identities by using a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="proof-of-authority (PoA) system">proof-of-authority (PoA) system</span>, so that businesses and/or users can safely disclose customer data when holding, keeping, converting, or selling virtual assets. To avoid further complicating the explanation of this process, this entire cycle is prioritized under <span class="tooltip" data-definition="VASPs (virtual asset service providers)">VASPs (virtual asset service providers)</span>, which is what an average business or user must verify themselves as to securely manage this data as before mentioned under the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="FATF (Financial Action Task Force) policy">FATF (Financial Action Task Force) policy</span>. This policy is a major key in running an organization with clients under the blockchain, regardless of what the brand may represent, and is what the Shyft platform works under to make sure businesses operate under such conditions. On a side note, FATF existed far before blockchain technology took place, establishing in 1989 by the G7 summit to combat illegal activities such as money laundering by creating measures that can eventually take place for digital security as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the topic of Ethereum is a major example for the average blockchain network 
            largely capable of using these security methods, it is important to mention one parallel 
            that so to speak directly combines a blockchain wallet with identity protection, and that 
            is called a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="daemon wallet" title="Daemon Wallet: A blockchain wallet incorporating identity protection features to prevent various types of attacks and ensure secure transactions">daemon wallet</span>. Referring once more back to our previous article, the ‘race 
            attack’ which is a way for hackers to steal digital assets within a smart contract by 
            sending cryptocurrency in exchange for the asset, that doesn’t get confirmed by the 
            user leading to the transaction being proved invalid and sending the paid money back 
            to the buyer, the daemon wallet combats this by making use of a software called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Enjin" title="Enjin: A software used in daemon wallets to sign and confirm transactions for Ethereum addresses">Enjin</span> 
            in order to make sure that any sort of transaction linked directly to an Ethereum address 
            can sign and confirm anything that is given in exchange for another asset or 
            cryptocurrency, in order to avoid any mistakes where something has not been directly 
            confirmed only to lead to another race attack led by the hacker themselves. How does 
            this relate to identity protection? Next to the fact that this combats another 
            major branch of hacking methods by a hacker, the Enjin software manages the exchanges, or 
            the act of holding and keeping digital assets like an average business would be doing 
            with customer data, by functioning within the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Enjin Platform Identity" title="Enjin Platform Identity: Identity management system closely linked with the daemon wallet and Enjin software for secure transactions">Enjin Platform Identity</span> that the daemon 
            wallet is closely linked with in order to make sure ETH addresses are not caught up in 
            confusion and are carefully initiated when the marketplace is finalizing and verifying 
            multiple transactions at once. Next to users themselves, some cryptocurrencies out 
            there try to work under Enjin to make sure there is 100% verification in exchanges, one 
            of these being a well-known cryptocurrency called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="XMR (Monero)" title="XMR (Monero): A well-known cryptocurrency">XMR (also known by the name
