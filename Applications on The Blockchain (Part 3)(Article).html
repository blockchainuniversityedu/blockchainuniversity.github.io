				<h3> Blockchain & Identity Protection</h3>
				<br><br><br>
				<center>
				<h2> In-Depth Explanation </h2>
				</center>
                  <p>
                    As we’ve previously covered various security vulnerabilities that take place within 
					blockchain networks, ranging from 51% attacks where hackers can assume governance 
					over the nodes of users within the network to Sybil attacks where fake identities can be 
					created in order to solicit invalid transactions, in this article we will narrow down the 
					subject into how various applications beyond the methods of two-factor authentication 
					and making use of cold storages can cover safety in specific areas of the field most 
					importantly one being identity protection.
					<br><br><br>
                    Since there is a lot to cover, we’ll be covering the Civic application, which is responsible 
					for creating diverse ecoysystems of identity fraud protection by making use of 
					something called DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) solely responsible for creating a 
					decentralized format for identities to be managed by significant users especially for the 
					long-term. The process of Civic involves having a friendly user interface for those to 
					control their own interactions which acts as data to be sustained under a specific 
					blockchain protocol, at which various public institutions that take place in the 
					government as well as health care can manage personal information with patients and 
					clients by getting a hold of a digital passport.
					<br><br><br>
                    Like any other means of verifying identity, digital passports which work under VCs 
					(Verifiable Credentials) function as a way to incorporate trust into those establishing 
					network connections within the blockchain mainframe with a particular ID that can 
					withhold the validation of such activity to prevent security intrusions against identity on 
					all ends of the spectrum. If you’ve read our article about making use of a blockchain 
					wallet, it can be carefully realized that the same way your identity can be protected 
					offline through cold storages, hot storages have an ever-developing solution that can 
					assist with reassuring careful management of resources by a specific identity, under 
					verifiable conditions.
					<br><br><br>
                    Second to having VCs supported by DIDs, another essential input that is given as a 
					responsibility amongst users themselves is having the skillset in managing 
					cryptographic keys that may allow them to access such as applications and platforms. In 
					simple terms, the connection to self-sovereignty over identifiable data usages by the 
					user is solely relied on PII (personally identifiable information). Since private keys thanks 
					to errors in application development and code defects within smart contracts are major 
					loopholes for hackers, as explained in detail in the article below this one, it must be 
					carefully admired that cryptographic keys must me made use of in order to sustain PII 
					over a long period of time. For a more detailed explanation, in special instances where a 
					short address attack takes place so that hackers may either try to invade a node or 
					create a fake identity at which their address is shorter than the 20-byte string of data it 
					usually takes over, cryptographic keys are an algorithmic encryption method assuring 
					that any string of data within a public or private address assigned to any set of users 
					cannot be altered manually and is to be purely randomized, especially when major 
					exchanges under ERC-20 take place (a standard that is generally used to help operate 
					smart contracts under Ethereum cryptocurrencies function).
					<br><br><br>
                    Altogether, Civic alongside the helpful resources of these keys establish a way for users 
					to manage their PII with VCs and DIDs under a specific interface as a reliable application 
					for those seeking to make sure they’re not victims of common attacks. In addition to 
					this, relating back to the digital passport itself which is the be-all of identity protection 
					in any instance that doesn’t just take place within the blockchain, generally speaking, 
					digital held passport identities work under a system called SSI. This simply stands for 
					‘Single system image’, at which a large set of machines responsible for managing data 
					especially in the realm of digital assets, cryptograms, and currencies altogether appear 
					to be on one system which is what the passport itself partially represents. This 
					essentially helps with the process making sure nodes are balanced with migration, so 
					that certain progress such as exchanges can be saved or validified from one particular 
					node to another. As the IOTA (Internet of Things) method has been mentioned in our 
					previous article about cybersecurity, an average SSI system can have a major 
					contribution to this verification system, especially when there’s a high traffic of smart 
					contracts taking place within the network. Altogether, the digital passport is the most 
					important part of the cycle in making sure applications such as Civic can create a secure 
					platform similar to that of cold storages (a way to use a blockchain wallet offline to 
					manage financial data), in order to help any user manage their own data without major 
					organizations looking over it themselves.
					<br><br><br>
                    Relating to the topic of trust, which is the sole reason why smart contracts under a 
					default blockchain format exists, other applications also create reassurance for different 
					branches of identity protection that doesn’t just have to do with PII management. One 
					of these is a platform by the name of Shyft, which next to the private user, is 
					personalized for major businesses that can utilized the application in sourcing their own 
					data across a blockchain network with the use of a ‘credibility score’, at which their 
					trustworthiness relies on how much of their organization has not be detected for any 
					kind of fraud under the verification process that the system puts the business through. 
					Similar to Civic, Shyft works under a distinct established protocol by the name of 
					Veriscope which functions by making use of smart contracts to create a layer within the 
					Ethereum network of identities by using a proof-of-authority (PoA) system, so that 
					businesses and/or users can safely disclose customer data when holding, keeping, 
					converting or selling virtual assets. To avoid further complicating the explanation of this 
					process, this entire cycle is prioritized under VASPs (virtual asset service providers), 
					which is what an average business or user must verify themselves as being to securely 
					manage this data as before mentioned under the Finacal Action Task Force (FATF) policy. 
					This is a policy that is a major key in running an organization with clients under the 
					blockchain, regardless of what the brand may represent, and is what the Shyft platform 
					works under to make sure businesses operate under such conditions. On a side note, 
					FATF existed far before blockchain technology took place, establishing in 1989 by the G7 
					summit to combat illegal activities such as money laundering by creating measures that 
					can eventually take place for digital security as well.
					<br><br><br>
                    Since the topic of Ethereum is a major example for the average blockchain network 
					largely capable of using these security methods, it is important to mention one parallel 
					that so to speak directly combines a blockchain wallet with identity protection, and that 
					is called a daemon wallet. Referring once more back to our previous article, the ‘race 
					attack’ which is a way for hackers to steal digital assets within a smart contract by 
					sending cryptocurrency in exchange for the asset, that doesn’t get confirmed by the 
					user leading to the transaction being proved invalid and sending the paid money back 
					to the buyer, the daemon wallet combats this by making use of a software called Enjin 
					in order to make sure that any sort of transaction linked directly to an Ethereum address 
					can sign and confirm anything that is given in exchange for another asset or 
					cryptocurrency, in order to avoid any mistakes where something has not been directly 
					confirmed only to lead to another race attack led by the hacker themselves. How does 
					this relate to identity protection? Next to the fact that this combats another 
					major branch of hacking methods by a hacker, the Enjin software manages the exchanges, or 
					the act of holding and keeping digital assets like an average business would be doing 
					with customer data, by functioning within the Enjin Platform Identity that the daemon 
					wallet is closely linked with in order to make sure ETH addresses are not caught up in 
					confusion and are carefully initiated when the marketplace is finalizing and verifying 
					multiple transactions at once. Next to users themselves, some cryptocurrencies out 
					there try to work under Enjin to make sure there is 100% verification in exchanges, one 
					of these being a well-known cryptocurrency called XMR (also known by the name 
					Montero).
					<br><br><br>
                    If you’ve made it this far into the article, a lot of the applications and terminology 
					supported by them, links to one particular sign of how Web 3.0 will change how an 
					average person interacts with their data, by creating a decentralized information plaza 
					for businesses and potential users in the mainframe to make use of applications that 
					can fully validate and streamline the intentions they have with their products under the 
					circumstances at which control by larger organizations do not take their place, as many 
					have done so already in the Web 2.0 space.
