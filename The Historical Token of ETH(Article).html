				<h1> The Historical Token Of: </h1>
				<h3> Ethereum </h3>
				<br>
                  <p>
					<br><br><br>
					From a historical perspective, the ongoing activities behind cryptocurrency on the 
					blockchain stems from a combination between collaboration and knowledge sharing. 
					In this particular article, we’ll be discussing how the major currency known 
					today by the name Ethereum, made use of this advantage alongside the many 
					extensions that came off of it to create tools that are known and appreciated today.
					<br><br><br>
					Beginning in 2015, the entire focus of blockchain technology had shifted through a 
					period of 4 different phases of the currencies trading, which altogether led to the 
					currencies major fruition in how social groups on the network interact with finance 
					today.
					<br><br><br>
					As the flow of information cannot exist without a set standard of systems put in place, 
					what’s detailed to be essential here is how the creation and mention of smart contracts 
					in 1996 by Nick Szabo, created the essential spark in ideas that would ultimately lead 
					to the development of the blockchain in 2009 by the still-anonymous figure Satoshi 
					Nakamoto. Through forums, and internet collaboration, like the pioneer himself, a 
					couple of developers came together to strengthen the ultimate development of a 
					decentralized network that wouldn’t necessarily have to serve as an altcoin just in its 
					surface level.
					<br><br><br>
					In 2013, the core collaboration of the team behind Ethereum were a major set of 
					people, these being Vitalik Buterin, Dr. Gavin Wood, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, 
					Joseph Lubin, and Charles Hoskinson. Although these names may sound unfamiliar, 
					they are soon going to be important near the end of this article.
					<br><br><br>
					Generally speaking, the entire development of blockchain technology is divided 
					between the use of forks, it is what platforms such as GitHub use to align strings of 
					code together without having to make multiple programs run separately from each 
					other while they’re meant to be combined to make a piece of software run on an 
					operating system. These forks, were essentially split between 4 different phases, 
					though this is important, what must be thought of is the initial branch of development 
					that ultimately led to the cryptocurrency gaining its traction.
					<br><br><br>
					Throughout the summer of 2016, an organization was developed called DAO, which 
					stands for the decentralized autonomous organization, a specifically organized 
					collaboration between groups that was meant to secure governance and security 
					within the blockchain by helping to branch members together in a network without a 
					hierarchy having to take place. If you’re familiar with the term hierarchy, you could also 
					refer back to our article about the web 3.0 platform Audius, which is essentially 
					focused on the same thing, using currency to ensure safety and security for a user on 
					the network, with the help of smart contracts.
					<br><br><br>
					Without a DAO, it would be near impossible for security to ever have any value on the 
					network, as a particular alignment of transactions must be agreed upon with the use of 
					sharing verified information amongst a group of people, like you typically would have 
					to when you’re crypto mining amongst a legion of miners who are busy with using 
					GPUs to solve math algorithms. Although Ethereum is one of the biggest currencies 
					that help to drive cryptocurrency mining, it is a topic that is still developing, and will be 
					taught to its fullest extent in later workshops.
					<br><br><br>
					By meeting conditions of the DAO, Buterin was able to create a mechanism as part of a 
					fork, at which he was able to balance both efficiency and security in Ethereum through 
					a mechanism called proof-of-stake. Unlike proof-of-work, the main difference between 
					either terms is that proof-of-stake is more secure, in that the opening of new blocks 
					originating from the genesis block on the network is done so on the premise that those 
					who have governing coins in their cold or hot wallets are validated to be able to not 
					only perform crypto mining, but are also required to have validators that will help them 
					to continue making transactions.
					<br><br><br>
					Going back to the Audius example, without validators in the network who may carefully 
					verify the amount of coins you have, those with higher amounts of stakes in coins are 
					more likely to be given the privilege of actually performing transactions. It would be 
					important to mention that, owning stakes in a cryptocurrency is like giving a down 
					payment for a newly purchased car, it secures the purchase in case anything ever 
					happens and proceeds to help hold governance over the transaction.
					<br><br><br>
					In case you’re wondering, both PooW and PooS uses the similar mechanisms, though 
					proof-of-stake is focused on a random selection of validators that will confirm the 
					creation of new blocks based on the spread of coins between members, whereas 
					proof-of-work is more or less a version of this idea with an even amount of traffic 
					spread amongst parallel and identical blockchains. Buterin, having adopted this 
					transition between PooW and PooS, was able to save energy towards the use and 
					development of Ethereum, as it saves power and costs that would otherwise be too 
					expensive and potentially harmful to the business.
					<br><br><br>
					Speaking of funding, next to the initial appearance of DAOs and its ability to save costs 
					to improve security, the extension to this idea had many investors pay attention to the 
					concept of ETH especially after the initial release of the white paper (concept proposal 
					and blueprint) to financial experts looking to invest in new ideas. With a rise up of 
					18,000 investors through an ICO, Buterin had already raised 11 million dollars worth of 
					ETH through a decentralized venture fund, though do to security flaws and coding 
					defects in smart contracts, various funders of the project would essentially withdraw 
					their profits from initially supporting the ‘then’ early idea of an alternative Bitcoin.
					<br><br><br>
					Although setbacks had occurred early on in the world of Ethereum, it can be carefully 
					considered that at the careful handle of collaboration, other applications took early 
					notes of the upcoming currency by 2016. In case you haven’t heard of this application, 
					MetaMask has been one of the major digital wallets existing on the blockchain, used 
					for purchasing property of all sorts such as NFTs, and ultimately providing ease-of-
					access to financial information without risk of potential attacks occurring.
					<br><br><br>
					By the time Ethereum had appeared and became a go-to currency for tools that 
					weren’t necessarily for use of its altcoin mainframe, through developing a user 
					experience for those seeking to develop accounts that will instantly store back-end 
					cryptographic data, it was assured that a major growth in the monthly user base for the 
					application would eventually reach to its 100 million members by 2022. Through this 
					diversion from a setback to a collaboration, Ethereum was not only more accessible, 
					but easier to be invested not just from financial experts ranging from Wall Street but 
					also from separate individuals.
					<br><br><br>
					By May 31st, 2023, 120 millions of coins in ETH were in circulation, with a market cap of 
					2.5 billion dollars. Now, you may believe this was the only version of ETH holding a 
					value of overing 1,000$ individually (specifically 1,874$), there was another version of 
					this altcoin that remained to have rised up to a greater value, which went by the name 
					Ethereum Classic. As previous coins are solely focused on using DAOs and smart 
					contracts to suggest governance over financial value and expansion amongst each 
					member on the network, ETC was specifically designed to completely divert initial 
					base formats of smart contracts by creating a new branch of the same mechanism 
					responsible for PooW and PooS systems, by catering to a special interest for people to 
					use parallel chains on the network which will foster a community of data engineers that 
					may develop applications at a limitless rate without censorship.
					<br><br><br>
					It is the sole definition of governance in the network, that has the same capabilities of 
					ETH, only developing to make use of a different standard that isn’t ERC-720 or ERC-
					1150. As commercialization, regardless of whether or not the product is in a 
					decentralized environment or not, is applied to Ethereum in ways that most would not 
					predict this rise user engagement on such a standard range in time. Through 
					consistent marketing, and a node infrastructure that would instantly support use of the 
					platform at a higher rate than Bitcoin, 400,000+ developers are now capable of 
					building and preserving applications on the platform with the use of Ethereum and the 
					subduing applications that come after such as MetaMask.
					<br><br><br>
					In order to expand a little more on the integration of the currency, MetaMask was not 
					the only application that would take ETH tokens into different accounts. Considering 
					that Ethereum works under its own API, the integration process fell forward into the 
					hands of web3 developers looking to implement it into their own wallet mainframes 
					that are individually called dApps. A dApp, in accordance with the description of the 
					main documentation of Ethereum terms, is an application that combines smart 
					contracts with the activity of front end users to develop an interface which shares 
					these contracts transparently so that the free interaction that clients demand towards 
					deploying anonymity and storing data with integrity is possible.
					<br><br><br>
					As mentioned before, ETC, which is valued at 140 million coins, is designed to 
					intertwine with both the use of ETH and this new network of adopting applications 
					altogether. Now, at the beginning of this article, something of the term ‘fork’ was 
					mentioned. A fork, is simply a branch of code from already existing prompt of working 
					programming languages, in order to create new software and applications. Many 
					cryptocurrencies, either being altcoins or stablecoins, are essentially just forks of the 
					initial Bitcoin standard, which for specificity reasons is SHA-256 that helps with 
					forming hash numbers for identity performing infinite transactions on the network 
					itself.
					<br><br><br>
					The network itself in hindsight, next to ETC and ETH’s own branch of dApps, is simply 
					made up of currencies with the use of DAOs and ICOs that act as forks of what Satoshi 
					Nakamoto initially created and forwarded to developers looking to create stablecoins 
					and altcoins. As the general discussion behind Ethereum has thus far in this article 
					been narrowed to the thoughts and acts of Buterin as well as his colleagues, the 
					documentations can also be displayed through real-life events for marketing 
					purposes, as I’ve mentioned before that commercialization is the remaining 
					importance apart from technicalities that help to grow the network on a fundamental 
					level.
					<br><br><br>
					Between 2013 and 2015 for example, Vitalik Buterin had appearance in conference 
					during January 2014 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, introducing 
					the currency officially to a major group of people already invested into the idea, with 
					one particular person before the conference about 2 months earlier in November 2013, 
					going by the name Joseph Lubin, someone who later joined Buterin to work on the 
					project by developing the Ethereum Foundation, and organization responsible for 
					creating the studio ConsenSys focused on providing decentralized software services 
					to various large-scale corporations.
					<br><br><br>
					Once again, next to MetaMasks adoption of the ETH and ETC fork, as well as the 
					expansion of dApps, and the sourcing of the crypto-based application through Joseph 
					Lubin’s contribution, these essential milestones brought the activity of the currency to 
					where it is beyond what it was initially perceived to be in 2013. Keep in mind, every idea 
					behind a Web 3.0 application, is introduced through a white paper, at which the idea 
					began with Byterin as a release to the public in Winter 2013, which then in time led to 
					fork transitions such as the Beacon Chain upgrade mentioned before, public 
					appearances, and of course collaborations with other enthusiasts. Altogether, it is 
					essential to say that ETH is ever so slightly using the decentralized format of the 
					community to build bigger and better tools for the next generation of the internet, and 
					it also suggests that, sometimes hierarchy of apps and users will not promote as much 
					as innovation as the timeline of creating a major product.

Through consistent marketing, and a node infrastructure that would instantly support use of the platform at a higher rate than Bitcoin, 400,000+ developers are now capable of building and preserving applications on the platform with the use of Ethereum and the subduing applications that come after such as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="MetaMask: A digital wallet for managing Ethereum-based assets, enabling access to decentralized applications (DApps) and NFTs." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">MetaMask</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to expand a little more on the integration of the currency, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="MetaMask: A digital wallet for managing Ethereum-based assets, enabling access to decentralized applications (DApps) and NFTs." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">MetaMask</span> was not the only application that would take <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETH: Ethereum - A decentralized blockchain network enabling smart contracts and DApps." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETH</span> tokens into different accounts. Considering that Ethereum works under its own API, the integration process fell forward into the hands of web3 developers looking to implement it into their own wallet mainframes that are individually called <span class="tooltip" data-definition="dApps: Decentralized Applications that run on a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">dApps</span>. A <span class="tooltip" data-definition="dApp: Decentralized Application that runs on a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">dApp</span>, in accordance with the description of the main documentation of Ethereum terms, is an application that combines smart contracts with the activity of front-end users to develop an interface which shares these contracts transparently so that the free interaction that clients demand towards deploying anonymity and storing data with integrity is possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As mentioned before, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETC: Ethereum Classic - A blockchain network maintaining the original Ethereum code after a contentious hard fork." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETC</span>, which is valued at 140 million coins, is designed to intertwine with both the use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETH: Ethereum - A decentralized blockchain network enabling smart contracts and DApps." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETH</span> and this new network of adopting applications altogether. Now, at the beginning of this article, something of the term ‘fork’ was mentioned. A <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Fork: A divergence in the blockchain, creating a new protocol version from the existing codebase." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">fork</span>, is simply a branch of code from already existing prompt of working programming languages, in order to create new software and applications. Many cryptocurrencies, either being altcoins or stablecoins, are essentially just forks of the initial Bitcoin standard, which for specificity reasons is SHA-256 that helps with forming hash numbers for identity performing infinite transactions on the network itself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The network itself in hindsight, next to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETC: Ethereum Classic - A blockchain network maintaining the original Ethereum code after a contentious hard fork." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETC</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETH: Ethereum - A decentralized blockchain network enabling smart contracts and DApps." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETH</span>’s own branch of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="dApps: Decentralized Applications that run on a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">dApps</span>, is simply made up of currencies with the use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">DAOs</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ICOs: Initial Coin Offerings - Crowdfunding method using cryptocurrency." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ICOs</span> that act as forks of what Satoshi Nakamoto initially created and forwarded to developers looking to create <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies designed to have stable value." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">stablecoins</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Altcoins: Alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">altcoins</span>. As the general discussion behind Ethereum has thus far in this article been narrowed to the thoughts and acts of Buterin as well as his colleagues, the documentations can also be displayed through real-life events for marketing purposes, as I’ve mentioned before that commercialization is the remaining importance apart from technicalities that help to grow the network on a fundamental level.

        <p>
            Between 2013 and 2015, for example, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Vitalik Buterin: Co-founder of Ethereum." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Vitalik Buterin</span> had an appearance in a conference during January 2014 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, officially introducing the currency to a major group of people already invested in the idea. One particular person before the conference, about 2 months earlier in November 2013, going by the name <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Joseph Lubin: Co-founder of Ethereum, founder of ConsenSys." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Joseph Lubin</span>, someone who later joined Buterin to work on the project by developing the Ethereum Foundation, an organization responsible for creating the studio ConsenSys focused on providing decentralized software services to various large-scale corporations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once again, next to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="MetaMask: A cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">MetaMask's</span> adoption of the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETH: Ethereum - A decentralized blockchain network enabling smart contracts and DApps." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETH</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="ETC: Ethereum Classic - A blockchain network maintaining the original Ethereum code after a contentious hard fork." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">ETC</span> fork, as well as the expansion of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="dApps: Decentralized Applications that run on a blockchain network." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">dApps</span>, and the sourcing of the crypto-based application through <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Joseph Lubin: Co-founder of Ethereum, founder of ConsenSys." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Joseph Lubin’s</span> contribution, these essential milestones brought the activity of the currency to where it is beyond what it was initially perceived to be in 2013. Keep in mind, every idea behind a Web 3.0 application is introduced through a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="White Paper: A document explaining the concept, technology, or purpose of a project." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">white paper</span>, at which the idea began with <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Vitalik Buterin: Co-founder of Ethereum." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">Byterin</span> as a release to the public in Winter 2013, which then in time led to fork transitions such as the Beacon Chain upgrade mentioned before, public appearances, and of course collaborations with other enthusiasts. Altogether, it is essential to say that ETH is ever so slightly using the decentralized format of the community to build bigger and better tools for the next generation of the internet, and it also suggests that sometimes hierarchy of apps and users will not promote as much as innovation as the timeline of creating a major product.
