    <h1> The Forgotten Crypto Exchange </h1>
    <h3> From The Future </h3>
      <p>
        <br>
        So far, there have been discussions about apps that have succeeded, but not so much regarding the kind that made it past the struggles of time. Historical instances such as the Silicon Valley Bank crisis have come to prove that thriving technologies do have the potential collapse without the right management of tasks on both the business and customer side of things, but there can always be businesses that did not fail but had to close down due to technological limitations and lack of efficient progress thanks to blockchain technology.
        <br><br><br>
        This brings us to the topic today of the major rise and fall of a specific exchange by the name of tZERO, an elevated alternate trading system during the late 2010s that had given itself a membership-focused approach to issuing the exchange of cryptocurrencies under the rendered permission of the SEC, or Securities and Exchange Commission. Initially based in New York City, the success of the exchange was partly due to rising trends in the process of investing into “digital securities”, an opportunity that allowed a time and place at which those interested in building portfolios online on a casual or professional level could do so via mobile apps. Since we are far passed the age at which only laptops could do half of what a phone can do today regarding life-related responsibilities such as financing things, tZERO in particular took advantage of this opportunity and aimed to achieve past what other exchanges such as Binance could not.
        <br><br><br>
        This was one of the first exchanges in blockchain history that had the government support it, as it was entirely in favor of the what the government was interested in doing at the time with the ongoing rise of Web 3.0 development. This alternate trading system so to speak, built within a crypto app, had headquartered itself in a busy city to achieve various things that had not ultimately reached the outcome that was initially promised. The goal behind tZERO at the time, was to facilitate tokenized shares to private companies, so that companies at interest of these market movements could have an easier introduction to the world of decentralized finance instead of having to search for more, subsidiary third party methods.
        <br><br><br>
        Since we are discussing an exchange, it’s also important to discuss other financial resources that indirectly associate with these crypto-based solutions, this mainly being NASDAQ markets that do about the same thing as tZERO would’ve done at the time. With this association usually appearing due to the connection between stablecoins traded on exchanges and real world currencies such as USD, which is popularly known to connect to USDC as well as Binance’s very own stablecoin BUSD, the consistency here was very much of benefit to tZERO as well. As consistent as trading between the real and digital world has been consistent in this decade, tZERO at the time was focused on using its different counterparts to fund the idea of merging major companies with cryptocurrency. To specify what tZERO was made of, roughly 55% of its ownership had belonged to a company once known as Overstock.com, which as of 2023 now goes by Bed Bath & Beyond. Considering that this exchange was a startup at the time, it was a joint venture with another early-stage company called BOX, meaning that many of its operations are pooling its resources with another organization. For clarification, BOX did not have to do the exact same thing as tZERO did for a joint operation to appear, as they worked on something somewhat relatable which related to developing marketing cloud-based tools for the sake of managing content on the internet.
        <br><br><br>
        Content creation, and government regulation, was merging together to create a space for communications between private companies and DeFi shareholders, yet, there was a continuing struggle in sustaining this activity for the long-term. Since the exchange was dependent on a token by the same name, it was coinciding with the ERC-20 standard of currencies, the protocol adopted by Ethereum to create the fungible tokens some of us reading about the space may know about today.
        <br><br><br>
        Compared to what was mentioned before regarding government regulation, tZERO was also the first exchange to be entirely based on a token of their own which had automatically opened interest groups to want to make use of their service for listing assets for example. Similar to how the NASDAQ market lists stocks, tZERO was aiming to be the ‘alternative’ trading system. How these assets are listed and presented to private companies, were more or less followed by a particular strategy called the bulletin-board method, at which equity held available at a specific company was to be sold and seen available unless many portions of it had existed and were accessible.
        <br><br><br>
        In essence, it was the go-to method of prioritizing a token that would let private companies understand the liquidation of assets at any given time, and to make business decisions based on that, especially since it was being monitored by the SEC at the hands of officially registered companies. Practices known to be general in stock markets, such as buying and asking or bidding prices, were now being held to ease-of-access inside of this crypto app, introducing a total of 3 cryptocurrencies in the process that would result in a 350% year-to-year increase in initial coin offerings, or 18 of them to be exact.
        <br><br><br>
        Being able to make technology more accessible, and then merging it with the streamlining of financial movements, made it a great formula for regulatory approval to take place in order for companies to freely trade in a market. Despite this being an advantage, there were still questions of legality that came to came to question in the months that these progressions were being put to place. At the beginning of the pandemic, since there was a sudden hike in the discussion of cryptocurrency, products connected to cryptocurrency were just being noticed for their ability to make use of verification processes for certain services to reach specific people, regardless of it included legal concerns or not.
        <br><br><br>
        For example, in January 2019, tZERO was accused of sharing undisclosed information of a deal that took place between Blue Ocean Technologies and a broker within Singapore. Something similar had happened once more, and this time tZERO was ordered on behalf of the SEC pay 800,000$ in damages for leaking private information once more. Such processes of holding ICOs over startups with the legal reprucussions of potentially sharing private information had become an issue that not even NASDAQ or ATS (alternative trading systems) had to deal with.
        <br><br><br>
        Due to the implications of sharing private information to the public on behalf of an exchange, it became more or less difficult to safeguard such a problem as the verification processes of blockchain technology had not matched up to providing stronger security for companies aiming to make a profit off of asset listing under tZERO. Since the case wouldn’t have been the same for secondary markets as well, these being portions of the economy where lesser advantageous companies would share bonds and stocks, tZERO would have had to figure out a way to innovate at a regular level, and keep making the correct payments in any possibility that they’d once again leak information to the public.
        <br><br><br>
        As brokers and dealers were getting involved, tZERO had created a branch from their platform called tZERO Markets, which had focused on taking care of clients that wanted to be on the buying and selling side of credible investments in order to help build a good investment portfolio. At this very point, tZERO was reaching from the general investor side of stock trading in a regulated crypto market, to an individual one as well, yet the ongoing concerns of whether or not this trading was allowed was still being discussed, especially those equivalent under the US and even Asia.
        <br><br><br>
        To avoid any confusion with the timelines, this joint venture on behalf of Overstock (known today as Bed Bath Beyond) ranged from May 18th, 2018 to around March of 2020, which could’ve only meant that the definition of an asset from the real-world converted to the blockchain at the time, was only just going to become a format that would be followed by non-fungible tokens. Since the technology of the blockchain was not developed to tZERO’s expectations of having companies trade with ground security, their focus instead was to make sure the developments would finalize 10 years ahead by 2030, in order to then become the leading innovator of an organization.
        <br><br><br>
        The promises of portfolio diversification at the hands of proper cybersecurity, and even insurance coverages, provided the gateway for investors to have their minds right with the trustworthiness of the platforms data exchanging principles. Though, since we’ve mentioned the SEC’s involvement with other crypto exchanges such as Binance before, it’s safe to say that especially in the US, labelling cryptocurrency as a “registered” asset was still difficult, considering that many policies hadn’t been set in place to ensure the scope of the resource in the same fashion as you would for say, a piece of property for example.
        <br><br><br>
        Speaking of property, tZERO had even opened it’s own ATS to even allow digital securities trading in secondary markets, towards a luxury resort in Aspen, Colorado, which at the time had accounted for 19% of the property’s shareholder value. Such dealings unlike mentioned before were possible, as tZERO was run under their own group called tZERO Group Inc, which did facilitate transactions, but it did not offer brokerage advice with properties, nor did they use their customer service to help with investment banking. It was their purpose to be a resource over the assets that were being traded, with the financial actions mentioned before taking place within the investor or individual. At the end, pushing forward an idea in a quickly moving field of competition, for a concept that could exist in 10 years time, led to tZERO shutting down their operations on March 6th of 2023 in fear that the SEC would charge further damages as a result of unstable activity behind what would be considered today as unregistered assets.
        <br><br><br>
        Altogether, this exchange was once the promising benefactor of a future at which a full mergence would be established between the real-world of companies, and the DeFi systems of the blockchain world, under a private level that would be accessible to the individual or the investor. The quick ending to this spark of innovation can only mean one thing, cryptocurrency is still ‘new’, and building large infrastructures around it will take a certain amount of time, community effort, and most importantly a major source of trust. In conclusion, the future ahead will introduce newer resources under the blockchain, which will only meet to interest more customers at the support of efficient product marketing as well, only building the future for what’s to come next in how we’ll be transitioning from a Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 internet generation.

        <h1> The Forgotten Crypto Exchange </h1>
        <h3> From The Future </h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          In the past, there have been many discussions and generalizations about currently existing movements in <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A financial currency traded and valued on a decetralized network (ex. Bitcoin)">cryptocurrencies</span>, their appropriate <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Official institutions at which cryptocurrencies are traded simultaneously,">exchanges</span>, and even some of the newer projects that are being worked on to suggest greater importance for the next generation of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A series of blocks, creating a chain network connected via hash identifiers with no central input or output.">blockchain</span> users. Though, we haven’t inherently discussed resources of this nature that have been forgotten, historical instances such as the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The bankruptcy of a tech-based financial institution that took place in early-2023.">Silicon Valley Bank crisis</span> have been covered, but specific timelines of which organizations fully directed towards decentralized networks haven’t necessarily been mentioned on a greater scale. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This brings us to the topic today of the major rise and fall of a specific exchange by the name of tZERO, an elevated <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An alternative method for how stock exchanges operate.">alternate trading system (ATS)</span> during the late 2010s that had given itself a membership-focused approach to issuing the exchange of cryptocurrencies under the rendered permission of the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A government agency overseeing operations relating to stock trading.">SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)</span>, or Securities and Exchange Commission. Initially based in New York City, the exchanges success was a motion predicated on establishing <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The electronic format of securities backed by real-world assets such as stocks, bonds, etc.">"digital securities"</span>, a time and place at which those interests in financing their portfolios can make use of mobile apps and their corresponding resources to maintain operations that can help to mostly manage <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Alternative coins that can be easily generated, replaced, or duplicated.">altcoins</span> and sometimes even <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Coins supported by the valuation of fiat currency such as the US dollar.">stable coins</span>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This exchange was one of the first times of which, it was supported entirely by the government’s interests, something that had not become the frequented nature of blockchain resources from before. This alternate trading system so to speak, built within a crypto app, had headquartered itself in a busy city to achieve various things that had not ultimately reached the outcome that was essentially promised, which at the time was to facilitate <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Shares of a public or private company, stored in listed tokens on a primary market.">tokenized shares</span> to private companies, so that the corporations at interest of these market movements could have an easier introduction to the world of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Finance that is operated within the blockchain.">decentralized finance (DeFi)</span> instead of having to search for more, subsidiary third party methods. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Now, as we’ve mentioned in the past, the NASDAQ markets have had indirect relations to the trading of cryptocurrency, especially since the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A type of currency not directly connected to a natural resource, such as gold.">fiat currency</span> that it trades is connected to stable coins such as one that used to be BUSD (Binance USD). This particular connection was very much consistent within the field of tZERO as well, as 55% of its ownership belonged to a company once known as <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An online retail marketplace known today as Bed Bath And Beyond.">Overstock.com</span>, which as of 2023 now goes by Bed Bath & Beyond. Considering that this exchange was a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The state of a company when it's undergoing beginning stages of production.">start-up</span> at the time, it was a joint venture with another early-stage company called BOX, meaning that many of its operations are pooling its resources with another organization, for which at this case BOX was responsible marketing cloud-based tools for the sake of managing efficient content. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Content creation, and government regulation, was merging together to create a space for communications between <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A company held privately in a product-sharing market.">private companies</span> and DeFi shareholders, yet, there was a continuing struggle in sustaining this activity for long. Since the exchange was dependent on a token by the same name, it was coinciding with the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="One of many protocols under Ethereum, known for creating eligbility for the development of fungible tokens.">ERC-20 standard</span> of currencies, the protocol adopted by Ethereum to create the fungible tokens some of us reading about the space may know today. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Basing it off the token, consistent interests wanted their to be a listing of assets like their would be on a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Short for the 'National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations', an electronic trading platform in the US.">NASDAQ</span>, hence making it the ‘alternative’ trading system. How these assets are listed and presented to private companies, were more or less followed by a particular strategy called the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An unofficial term for liquidizing listed assets on any given platform.">bulletin-board method</span>, at which equity held available at a specific company was to be sold and seen available unless many portions of it had existed and been accessible. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In essence, it was the go-to method of prioritizing a token that would let private companies understand the liquidation of assets at any given time, and to make business decisions based on that, especially since it was being monitored by the SEC at the hands of officially registered companies. Buying and asking, bidding prices, general known practices in stock markets were now being held to ease-of-access inside of this crypto app, introducing a total of 3 cryptocurrencies in the process that would result in a 350% year-to-year increase in <span class="tooltip" data-definition="When investors pool their assets as an offer to finance a particular token built on an organization.">initial coin offerings (ICOs)</span>, or 18 of them to be exact. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Being able to take accessible technology, and merge it with the streamlining of financial movements upon <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The approval of an important tool at the hands of regulations set by an official organization.">regulatory approval</span> was to benefit interested parties in grouped financing by a long shot, yet, questions of legality began to come arise in the coming months despite the progress made. See, during the year the pandemic began and the rise in traffic was more or less prevailing for cryptocurrency altogether, how crypto products were being integrated slowly demanded an adequate verification process of disclosing information that frankly was not always existing in most cases of legal due process. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For example, in January 2019, tZERO was <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Regulations and policies broken under SEC guidelines.">accused</span> of sharing undisclosed information of a deal that took place between Blue Ocean Technologies and a broker within Singapore. Another example of a coin offering that took place across the globe, yet, tZERO at the order of the SEC was put to pay 800,000$ in damages for this mistake. Coin offerings had still held to question whether or not cryptocurrency had the influence of being a truly registered asset in these trading systems, regardless of it was connected to a NASDAQ or an ATS. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Safeguarding those investing into them was by all means growing to be a priority overtime, with iterations taking place of which secondary market transactions are specifically restricted in order to continue to strengthen the streamlining of how investors would circulate their funds with shareholders and private organizations alike. Since this is a token-based exchange reliant on distributed ledger technology, with protocols covering <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An agreement between the buyer and seller in a blockchain that holds traded assets information on both sides is validated.">smart contracts</span>, innovating at a regular level and making the correct payments in case <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Fraudulent activities held in place when parties are disclosing private information.">securities fraud</span> was in the general dome of DeFi was only ever reaching to the interests of bigger markets as well. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As brokers and dealers were getting involved, tZERO had even created a branch platform called tZERO Markets, focused on taking care of clients that would be on the buying and selling side of catering to trades that weren’t on a credible investment level, but also meant to drive portfolio building towards the individual as well. At this very point, tZERO was reaching from the general investor side of stock trading in a regulated crypto market, to an individual one as well, yet the ongoing concerns of whether or not this trading was allowed, especially on behalf of countries outside of the US judiciary such as established exchanges held in Asia and Europe had continued.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To avoid any confusion with the timelines, this joint venture on behalf of Overstock (known today as Bed Bath Beyond) ranged from May 18th, 2018 to around March of 2020, which could’ve only meant that the definition of an asset, which is something held physical at the ownership of an individual or party was to be digitized at a level of which only currencies were to take ahold of its new definition. In this case, the community having really built an industry-leading crypto infrastructure, tZERO’s focus 10 years ahead by 2030 was to become the leading innovator in the quick and efficient settlement of coin offerings between organizations, helping the buying and selling side of client information to be closely pioneered with an interoperable world at which the limitlessness information coincided with processes with liquidity, and fractional ownerships of digital assets. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The promises of portfolio diversification at the hands of proper cybersecurity, and even insurance coverages, provided the gateway for investors to have their minds right with the trustworthiness of the platforms data exchanging principles. Though, since we’ve mentioned the SEC’s involved with other crypto exchanges such as Binance before, it’s safe to say that especially in the US, labelling cryptocurrency as a “registered” asset was still difficult, considering that many policies hadn’t been set in place to ensure the scope of the resource in the same fashion as you would for say, a piece of property for example. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Speaking of property, tZERO had even opened it’s ATS to even allow digital securities trading in secondary markets, towards a luxury resort in Aspen, Colorado, which at the time had accounted for 19% of the property’s shareholder value. Although such dealings are possible, tZERO was run under their own group called tZERO Group Inc, which did facilitate transactions, but did not offer <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Similar to an exchange, where buying and selling of stocks or bonds are held in place by a financial institution.">brokerage</span> advice with properties, nor did they use their customer service to help with investment banking. It was their purpose to be a resource over the assets that were being traded, with the financial actions mentioned before taking place within the investor or individual, yet, having potentially unofficial registered digital assets not fully monitored or constructed as legalized by the SEC became a concern that led to the eventual closing of the company on March 6th of 2023, in order to encourage securities products to be better obtained a stronger legal status by the SEC to avoid potential damages to be made further down the road when it came to crypto assets. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Altogether, this exchange was once the promising benefactor of a future at which a full mergence would be established between the real-world of companies, and the DeFi systems of the blockchain world, under a private level that would be accessible to the individual or the investor, but evidently it was too early to run such large units of processes with weaker than promised government regulations set in place. This can only mean one thing, cryptocurrency is still ‘new’, and building large infrastructures around it take time, community effort, and most importantly a major source of trust. In conclusion, the future ahead will introduce newer resources under the blockchain, which will only meet to interest more customers at the support of efficient product marketing as well, only building the future for what’s to come next in how we’ll be transitioning from a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The current era of our internet, where data is shared to a central database.">Web 2.0</span> to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The era of internet after Web 2.0, focused on running similar applications in a decentralized format.">Web 3.0</span> internet generation.
