                    As topics in further workshops such as asset management within blockchain 
					technology will be covered, a major part of this subject revolves around finance 
					which will be discussed and analyzed within this article. In the past few months, 
					the interconnection between blockchain applications and the management of financial tools 
					has been strictly solidified by the media in order to inform audiences about incidents 
					that involve the mismanagament of personal finances lying between people with the 
					use of cryptocurrency.
					<br><br><br>
                    Up until now, if you are still trying to understand the general concept behind 
					cryptocurrencies, they are essentially a digital currency “like” the Euro or the dollar that 
					is strongly affected by demand led by discussions around its general nature through 
					social media platforms as well as the level of investment an average person makes as a 
					result from hearing this information.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The main incident that took place in this example, is the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley 
					Bank, that reached its downfall alongside its clients due to an investment into 
					management firms that organized the finances of people’s money for a potential rate of 
					return through various cryptocurrencies also managed by them. When it comes 
					monetary transactions that take place anywhere from a cup of coffee bought at a mall 
					to a subscription plan for a streaming service, these are supported by an asset called 
					‘cash’, something that your average bank strongly includes into a balance sheet to 
					ensure that abnormalities in spending by yourself can be noticed at any given point.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Generally speaking, cryptocurrencies are split between two categories, one is the 
					average coin that is supported by a major increase or decrease in value depending on 
					its reputation discussed through the media (ex. renowned tech billionaire Elon Musk 
					promoting Dogecoin through platforms such as Twitter and the Tesla website), and the 
					second which fits under ‘stablecoins’. Telling by the name, these are ‘stable’ 
					cryptocurrencies that are supported by a linkage with cash held in a bank elsewhere. 
					What this means is, you are making an investment into a cryptocurrency with the use of 
					your own currency of the dollar (CAD or USD), hence the existence of such stablecoins 
					being popular in Binance USD or Tether USD. An explanation of how Binance works 
					regarding digital assets can be watched in this remote workshop on our YouTube 
					channel.
                    <br><br><br>
                    If you’ve ever used social media for a prolonged use of time, you would notice almost in 
					every instance that the general spread of word behind a particular person or product 
					can instantly affect the opinion of each invididual within the sample census being 
					informed, hence forth making it ‘contagious’. This supports the ‘contagion theory’, 
					which is the sole culprit of the downfall of these financial institutions as well as their 
					linked investment with technology startups.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Throughout the pandemic, both in Canada as well as the US, a major hike in inflation 
					had taken place making it difficult for citizens to increase their spending. To combat 
					this, the US Federal Reserve began to print more money, increasing interest rates and 
					lowering the inflation so that consistent financial transactions became frequented. As 
					this is typical in economic recessions, one specific element of the system that’s been 
					outlined by this change is the investment of people’s monetary transactions towards 
					cryptocurrencies through crypto hedge funds.
                    <br><br><br>
                    When you are depositing money into a bank, your personal finances are not precisely 
					held in one place, it may be partially shared with other companies or placed into 
					investments for people looking to start one, and firms that promise to manage such 
					resources such as hedge funds tend to fall into the same category. As ‘trust’ is the word 
					to keep in mind in this situation, there is a spectrum of the term that ranges between a 
					solid understanding of knowing that you’ll be able to withdraw and deposit your money 
					at any time within a bank with limited knowledge of where it goes, versus lending your 
					personal finances to a startup that gives a “promise” in making a return on your 
					investment into one of their organized cryptocurrencies with a return relied on word of 
					mouth.
                    <br><br><br>
                    As this spectrum is applied to these tech startups, the financial institutions that bought 
					and sold bonds from these companies are what were ultimately disrupting the cycle of 
					asset management. Back to the topic of ‘contagion theory’, due to a sudden rise in 
					inflation once more by the Federal Reserve to reduce spending and decrease interest 
					rates, technology startups such as BlockFi, Circle, Avalanche, Ripple, Proof, and Yuga 
					Labs were the sole proprietors that were affected by the sudden shift in the economy as 
					well as the value of their managed cryptocurrencies, since it failed to meet expectations 
					in making a strong return in investments towards clients. The Silicon Valley Bank was 
					amongst one of the major financial institutions involved in this bankruptcy, and the 
					major reason why the economic turmoil had a far more grandiose effect than otherwise 
					expected.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Generally speaking, next to stablecoins, a company that is not able to print money or 
					does not have assets to back up its bankruptcy, is generally likely to be held liable for 
					excessive debts and therefore be unable to last for a longer time period in the economy. 
					This applies specifically to bond ratings, as buying and sellings bonds from 
					organizations with a (B, BB, BBB) rating are to generally give somewhat promising 
					returns on their buyers, whereas as (A, AA, AAA) rated bonds may guarantee an instant 
					and fully guaranteed return on investment. Amongst organizations that are less likely to 
					go bankrupt, the major one is the Federal Reserve with a bond rating of AAA, meaning 
					that any point they can print money to increase spending and supply of cash to drop 
					inflation and influence spending. Due to the recent bankruptcies, citizens of the US have 
					been struggling to regain their losses, hence why the Federal Reserve acts on repaying 
					citizens that have lost significant finances due to their investments in tech startups.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Various professionals who continue to speak about this industry, generally tend to 
					understand the situation with how politicians and financiers understand the system, 
					with podcast host Brad Nickel from ‘Mission: DeFi’ explaining “A lot of us believe that 
					cryptocurrency and blockchain are superior technology for running the financial 
					system”, at which the response is that the risk associated with this interconnection 
					between blockchain networks and major financial management is not carefully 
					interpreted during the age of Web 3.0 and will take a careful streamlining of valid 
					information and education by the media to be sought into more stable conditions.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Altogether, the major derivation to take from these events, is that each individual must 
					consider staying informed about where their finances are being placed, especially when 
					it comes to terminology that is evolving to reach people’s ears without a direct 
					explanation. To see our recent workshop regarding this topic, please visit our 
					homepage! If you have any questions or concerns, please free to contact us
