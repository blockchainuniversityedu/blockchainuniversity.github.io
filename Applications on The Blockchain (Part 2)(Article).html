				<h1> Applications on The Blockchain (Part 2) – Blockchain & Music Entertainment</h1>
				<h3> What is Audius?</h3>
				<br>
                  <p>
                    As we’ve covered in previous articles, blockchain technology is not just limited to the 
					way peers on a network can exchange information in a decentralized fashion, but it is 
					also driven towards subsituting various applications that puts the desires for 
					communications under different platforms at ease. In this article, we will be discussing 
					what can be considered a major turning point with how music is shared on the internet 
					as we transition from the Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 era.
					<br><br><br>
					Because we are in a transitional period between one era to another, tools on the 
					blockchain technology can simply be previewed, made use of, and improved upon in 
					the Web 2.0 space considering that there may still be limitations to platforming a 
					decentralized P2P network. Regarding the application we’ll be discussing in Part 2 of our 
					‘Applications on the Blockchain’ series, it goes by the name of Audius and may be 
					accessed through this link: audius.co. 
					<br><br><br>
					The essential premise of Audius is to create a decentralized avenue for musical artists 
					under one or various genres, that allows them to post their music and receive 
					compensation for it from other individuals through the use of cryptocurrencies. As this 
					may sound incredibly similar to SoundCloud, it holds a very distinct systemic approach 
					to how music is shared and distributed, without control of a major record label set in 
					place. Data on Audius is distributed through an extension on the website called AudSP, 
					which is responsible for making use of an IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) which stands 
					as a P2P protocol that creates ease-of-access for uploaded audio files that users want to 
					listen to.
					<br><br><br>
					The IPFS has been mentioned in prior articles, such as our first ‘Applications on the 
					Blockchain’ column covering the technical functionality behind the metaverse as well as 
					non-fungible tokens. As the IPFS is meant to help sustain decentralized governance 
					over a particular market in the music industry that strives to interconnect artists more 
					than ever before, factors such as high engagement as well as on-chain metrics define 
					the success of being able to receive compensation under certain disadvantages that 
					copyrighted content can go unnoticed.
					<br><br><br>
					Because copyright protection in a decentralized platform is hard to pin down, especially 
					with other tools such as non-fungible tokens which is limited to being verified by 
					controlled ‘minting’ so to speak, the advantageous factors that the platform posseses is 
					involved in taking the hashed nodes on a blockchain network and like digital assets, 
					spreading work across various blocks that will not only establish high engagement in 
					music listening when possible, but also contribute to nurturing a community that helps 
					all artists remain interconnected on an ongoing basis.
					<br><br><br>
					More than ever, the commodity of having a digital asset does not have to remain
					limited to cryptocurrency, but instead a branch of resources that contribute to multiple 
					industries simultaneously without central control. Next to the cryptocurrencies that can 
					be exchanged through the IPFS-based storage solution that Audius is built on for 
					distributing music files across various peers on the network, it can also grant users 
					cryptocurrency created by Audius itself called AUDIO. In case you do not remember, 
					when it comes to building a financial in the world of digital asset management, it is 
					possible to receive free cryptocurrency through something such as airdrops, which is 
					what AUDIO serves to be.
					<br><br><br>
					When there is an increasing level of community engagement on your profile, receiving 
					or purchasing AUDIO may grant one to control their own node within the network, 
					meaning that you may connect the distribution of your music files to a crypto-based \
					block connected to a hash number, that will act as a way for you to exchange your 
					cryptocurrencies when linking together compensation for a particular track you’ve
					released. This not only stabilizes network security since you are in full control of a part 
					of a network, but also makes sure that there is incentivization towards acquiring access 
					to elements that an avid user who doesn’t own AUDIO may not have, simply because 
					they do not have governing rights through the control of node to maintain governance 
					of the platform.
					<br><br><br>
					Now, as we’ve mentioned disadvantages of this platform from before, adding onto the 
					fact that detection of copyright infringement is highly limited and difficult to sustain. 
					The reason for this strict limitation is simply because the content distributed in the 
					network of AUDIUS does not have a specific ID system linked to it, which means that 
					potential infringements especially over promotional materials that an average company 
					may be unable to take down, will simply go unnoticed and remain visible to users of the 
					platform. A solution for this problem is to be on the way for this procedural error, 
					according to the developers of Audius, but as of right now, a decentralized platform 
					may lead to a file infringement system that simply holds no restrictions.
					<br><br><br>
					Other disadvantages in this particular instance is that not all music may be original for 
					the user, which may lead to some artists discovering a track of theirs being made use of 
					by someone else, which can possibly create significantly damaging consequences for 
					the music industry. Professor Kevin Casini who studies entertainment law at the 
					Quinnipac School of Law in Conneticut, states that being able to deplatform someone 
					from posting music onto the site is highly unlikely, leading to the creation of an open 
					space that will enable those uploading different sorts of work not to face different sorts 
					of scrutiny of immediate evaluation.
					<br><br><br>
					Altogether, this is the first core application similar to the metaverse or the non-fungible
					tokens we’ve gone over, that is simply able to ease the process of distributing an artists
					rights of personal work across a network that can be based on governance by the
					individual instead of the organization, leading to a certain extent of simplicity that by 
					the hands of cryptocurrencies such as AUDIO, can simultaenously connect various artists 
					together who can exchange compensation as a reward for their hardwork.
