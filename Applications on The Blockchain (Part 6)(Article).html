        <h1> The Forgotten Crypto Exchange </h1>
        <h3> From The Future </h3>
      <p>
        In the past, there have been many discussions and generalizations about currently existing movements in cryptocurrencies, their appropriate exchanges, and even some of the newer projects that are being worked on to suggest greater importance for the next generation of blockchain users. Though, we haven’t inherently discussed resources of this nature that have been forgotten, historical instances such as the Silicon Valley Bank crisis have been covered, but specific timelines of which organizations fully directed towards decentralized networks haven’t necessarily been mentioned on a greater scale.

        This brings us to the topic today of the major rise and fall of a specific exchange by the name of tZERO, an elevated alternate trading system during the late 2010s that had given itself a membership-focused approach to issuing the exchange of cryptocurrencies under the rendered permission of the SEC, or Securities and Exchange Commission. Initially based in New York City, the exchanges success was a motion predicated on establishing “digital securities”, a time and place at which those interests in financing their portfolios can make use of mobile apps and their corresponding resources to maintain operations that can help to mostly manage altcoins and sometimes even stable coins.

      <p>
        This exchange was one of the first times of which, it was supported entirely by the government’s interests, something that had not become the frequented nature of blockchain resources from before. This alternate trading system so to speak, built within a crypto app, had headquartered itself in a busy city to achieve various things that had not ultimately reached the outcome that was essentially promised, which at the time was to facilitate tokenized shares to private companies, so that the corporations at interest of these market movements could have an easier introduction to the world of decentralized finance instead of having to search for more, subsidiary third party methods.

        Now, as we’ve mentioned in the past, the NASDAQ markets have had indirect relations to the trading of cryptocurrency, especially since the fiat currency that it trades is connected to stable coins such as one that used to be BUSD (Binance USD). This particular connection was very much consistent within the field of tZERO as well, as 55% of its ownership belonged to a company once known as Overstock.com, which as of 2023 now goes by Bed Bath & Beyond. Considering that this exchange was a startup at the time, it was a joint venture with another early-stage company called BOX, meaning that many of its operations are pooling its resources with another organization, for which at this case BOX was responsible marketing cloud-based tools for the sake of managing efficient content.

      <p>
        Content creation, and government regulation, was merging together to create a space for communications between private companies and DeFi shareholders, yet, there was a continuing struggle in sustaining this activity for long. Since the exchange was dependent on a token by the same name, it was coinciding with the ERC-20 standard of currencies, the protocol adopted by Ethereum to create the fungible tokens some of us reading about the space may know today.

        Basing it off the token, consistent interests wanted their to be a listing of assets like their would be on a NASDAQ, hence making it the ‘alternative’ trading system. How these assets are listed and presented to private companies, were more or less followed by a particular strategy called the bulletin-board method, at which equity held available at a specific company was to be sold and seen available unless many portions of it had existed and been accessible.

        In essence, it was the go-to method of prioritizing a token that would let private companies understand the liquidation of assets at any given time, and to make business decisions based on that, especially since it was being monitored by the SEC at the hands of officially registered companies. Buying and asking, bidding prices, general known practices in stock markets were now being held to ease-of-access inside of this crypto app, introducing a total of 3 cryptocurrencies in the process that would result in a 350% year-to-year increase in initial coin offerings, or 18 of them to be exact.

        Being able to take accessible technology, and merge it with the streamlining of financial movements upon regulatory approval was to benefit interested parties in grouped financing by a long shot, yet, questions of legality began to come arise in the coming months despite the progress made. See, during the year the pandemic began and the rise in traffic was more or less prevailing for cryptocurrency altogether, how crypto products were being integrated slowly demanded an adequate verification process of disclosing information that frankly was not always existing in most cases of legal due process.

        For example, in January 2019, tZERO was accused of sharing undisclosed information of a deal that took place between Blue Ocean Technologies and a broker within Singapore. Another example of a coin offering that took place across the globe, yet, tZERO at the order of the SEC was put to pay 800,000$ in damages for this mistake. Coin offerings had still held to question whether or not cryptocurrency had the influence of being a truly registered asset in these trading systems, regardless of it was connected to a NASDAQ or an ATS.

        Safeguarding those investing into them was by all means growing to be a priority overtime, with iterations taking place of which secondary market transactions are specifically restricted in order to continue to strengthen the streamlining of how investors would circulate their funds with shareholders and private organizations alike. Since this is a token-based exchange reliant on distributed ledger technology, with protocols covering smart contracts, innovating at a regular level and making the correct payments in case securities fraud was in the general dome of DeFi was only ever reaching to the interests of bigger markets as well.

        As brokers and dealers were getting involved, tZERO had even created a branch platform called tZERO Markets, focused on taking care of clients that would be on the buying and selling side of catering to trades that weren’t on a credible investment level, but also meant to drive portfolio building towards the individual as well. At this very point, tZERO was reaching from the general investor side of stock trading in a regulated crypto market, to an individual one as well, yet the ongoing concerns of whether or not this trading was allowed, especially on behalf of countries outside of the US judiciary such as established exchanges held in Asia and Europe had continued.

        To avoid any confusion with the timelines, this joint venture on behalf of Overstock (known today as Bed Bath Beyond) ranged from May 18th, 2018 to around March of 2020, which could’ve only meant that the definition of an asset, which is something held physical at the ownership of an individual or party was to be digitized at a level of which only currencies were to take ahold of its new definition. In this case, the community having really built an industry-leading crypto infrastructure, tZERO’s focus 10 years ahead by 2030 was to become the leading innovator in the quick and efficient settlement of coin offerings between organizations, helping the buying and selling side of client information to be closely pioneered with an interoperable world at which the limitlessness information coincided with processes with liquidity, and fractional ownerships of digital assets.

        The promises of portfolio diversification at the hands of proper cybersecurity, and even insurance coverages, provided the gateway for investors to have their minds right with the trustworthiness of the platforms data exchanging principles. Though, since we’ve mentioned the SEC’s involved with other crypto exchanges such as Binance before, it’s safe to say that especially in the US, labelling cryptocurrency as a “registered” asset was still difficult, considering that many policies hadn’t been set in place to ensure the scope of the resource in the same fashion as you would for say, a piece of property for example.

        Speaking of property, tZERO had even opened it’s ATS to even allow digital securities trading in secondary markets, towards a luxury resort in Aspen, Colorado, which at the time had accounted for 19% of the property’s shareholder value. Although such dealings are possible, tZERO was run under their own group called tZERO Group Inc, which did facilitate transactions, but did not offer brokerage advice with properties, nor did they use their customer service to help with investment banking. It was their purpose to be a resource over the assets that were being traded, with the financial actions mentioned before taking place within the investor or individual, yet, having potentially unofficial registered digital assets not fully monitored or constructed as legalized by the SEC became a concern that led to the eventual closing of the company on March 6th of 2023, in order to encourage securities products to be better obtained a stronger legal status by the SEC to avoid potential damages to be made further down the road when it came to crypto assets.

        Altogether, this exchange was once the promising benefactor of a future at which a full mergence would be established between the real-world of companies, and the DeFi systems of the blockchain world, under a private level that would be accessible to the individual or the investor, but evidently it was too early to run such large units of processes with weaker than promised government regulations set in place. This can only mean one thing, cryptocurrency is still ‘new’, and building large infrastructures around it take time, community effort, and most importantly a major source of trust. In conclusion, the future ahead will introduce newer resources under the blockchain, which will only meet to interest more customers at the support of efficient product marketing as well, only building the future for what’s to come next in how we’ll be transitioning from a Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 internet generation.
