				<h1> The Fundamentals Within </h1>
				<h3> A Digital World of Blockchain </h3>
				<br>
                <p>
                Within the Web 3.0 space, next to the cryptocurrencies set in place that is discussed in 
                the media, more opportunistic directions of the platform are showcased through the 
                use of tokens. Specifically to this, they are called "non-fungible" tokens, which are assets
                in the form of various digital or real-world assets, including artworks, GIFs, videos, 
                virtual avatars, in-game currencies, music, ownership certificates, legal contracts, and 
                more that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided. As they've gained popularity 
                within the space, this new format of digital art creation has provided opportunities for 
                artists to showcase their work without having to undergo the struggles of having to so-
                to speak, create your own art show or video game in order to showcase them.
				<br><br><br>
				In order to ensure that the movement of these non-fungible tokens do not spur traffic
                that may disrupt the creative process of these artists, the process of 'Token Standards' is 
                set in place which involves the procedure of encoding metadata that can help to verify a 
                particular asset to its appropriate owner. The setstone of these Token Standards largely 
                rely on the mint function of an NFT, which is meant to check the specifications of an 
                assets metadata which can involve hex values which can involve color codes, titles and 
                descriptions stored into a particular storage system called 'off-chain storage'. A lot of 
                these processes which are focused on ensuring the uniformities of the assets in a 
                fashion that can be freely shared within the peer-to-peer network of the blockchain, 
                depend largely on working within a 'decentralized' fashion, where unlike having your 
                work looked over by a potential organization within a central server, is focused on 
                making sure everything is shared across owners within the platform. With decentralized 
                servers, an IPFS which stands for 'Interplanetary File System', are meant to assure that 
                the assets are not interchangeable by transferring them from one system to another by 
                combining metadata with links upon the Token Standards mentioned earlier, in order to 
                establish an automatic encoding process which stores the information in an off-chain 
                storage system at ease. These standards, specific to NFTs in common, go by the name 
                ERC1155 and ERC721. To avoid complicating either of the two standards, we'll focus on 
                explaining what the ERC1155 standard is meant to represent. As 'hex' values have been 
                mentioned from before, this standard is essential in making use of fundamental 
                functions such as a uint256 variable_id, which helps in defining fungible tokens by the 
                ID of the owner for which it will be transferred from. Below is an algorithm that defines 
                this standard, as well as the metadata that gets stored into an off-chain storage.
				<br><br><br><i>
					// Algorithm 2: NFT Standard 1155
					interface IERC1155 
					{
					function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (address);
					function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 quantity) external payable
					}
				<br><br><br></i>
				This particular algorithm ensures that through functions such as 'transferFrom' and 
				'balanceOf', assets are externally traded between systems through an unsigned integer
				(uinit256) which is able to store non-negative integers. Second to this secure algorithm, 
				ERC721 is notable as well but consists of scalability issues as processes such as 
				compressing data in order to save off-chain file storage and uncompressing it to spare 
				higher resolution of the particular asset struggles to be distinguished, hence why it is 
				commonly replaced with the Flow-standard, a protocol developed by Dapper labs which 
				is implemented in order to make this process as smooth as possible. Referring back to 
				the sole structure of metadata, the hex values are commonly to be set in place through 
				the algorithm seen below.
				<br><br><br>
					// Algorithm 3: Metadata file
					{
					"name": "Color",
					"hex": "#F08080",
					"link": "https://bit.ly/3mdRahT",
					"owner": "0x6902702BB5678D7361C94441c71F600C255dd833"
					}
				<br><br><br>
				Using the "name", "hex", "link", and "owner" ID, this ensures to verify the ownership of a 
				particular asset to its rightful owner. Second to the standards mentioned, ERC721 is also 
				built into a special type of blockchain set by the major cryptocurrency exchange 
				company by the name of Binance, which goes by Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Similar in 
				many ways, BRC721 allows content creators to tokenize the ownership of their assets 
				and the data contained within it through a unique identifier, or DID (decentralized 
				identifier) which applies a private key to a particular owner that can use it to prove or 
				control their own identity. Similar to the algorithmic code behind ERC721, this one 
				implements the code of totalSupply, which is defined by the 'total amount of coins or 
				tokens of a specific cryptocurrency that have been created or mined, that are in 
				circulation, including those that are locked or reserved.'
				<br><br><br>
				As the tokenization of digital assets within the web 3.0 space ensures that there is 
				regulated circulation of transactions in order to manage the economy under a 
				regulatory fashion, issues may arise regarding profits behind these rightful ownerships 
				as verifying them through the process of minting may create major hikes or dips in its 
				value, since the value behind the transactions apart from metadata are largely reliant on 
				the general nature of the cryptocurrency it works behind. Though second to this, 
				another opportunity to combine these digital works within a collaborative space are 
				done so through the Metaverse, a decenetralized space where content creators or 
				explorers may make use of virtual or augmented reality headsets in interacting with a 
				three-dimensional streamline of world creations not limited by the space and time of 
				physical reality.
				<br><br><br>
				With this world consisting of seven layers, the ones that should be kept in mind 
				with understanding it are the human interface, infrastructure, and Internet of Things (IoT). 
				Regarding the human interface, this layer is focused on sharing experiences between 
				users of the world by helping to receive information useful in understanding the world 
				through spatial computing, where the VR or AR headset can be used in visually 
				understanding the digital space by associating it with the physical world. Adding onto 
				human interface, other layers such as the infrastructure are essential in improving 
				network connection technologies by using 5G and 6G, which can help with reducing the 
				congestion of network bandwidth. In finality, the Internet of Things is identified as a 
				layer in combining and constructing a 3D user interface that can help to associate the 
				physical world with the digital one by providing minimal effort for the user in making 
				data-driven judgements that can assist organizations in understanding utilizing the 
				platform, with specific mentions being virtual offices within the Metaverse where 
				companies may hold meetings. As these instances also require an actual environment 
				that can be worked within using augmented reality technology, the Metaverse may 
				collect important data such as biometric psychography in order to measure user data 
				emotions that are key in identifying concerns for privacy and data security, especially 
				when it's within an algorithmic bias that functions outside of the physical world and is 
				capable of identifying unintentional behavioral assumptions.
				<br><br><br>
				When it comes to improvements that the Metaverse can make, especially when it makes 
				use of NFTs, is to be able to provide an open-source space where users within a global 
				community have an opportunity to suggest solutions that may allow others to move 
				smoothly between various three-dimensional spaces in order to embody anything that 
				involves an avatar that is capable of sharing intercommunication experiences with 
				others. Though this is yet to be an improvement by large organizations, especially that 
				of Facebook which has mentioned the name at a multitude of times on social media, 
				industry partners and experts agree that such an ambitious concept requires a 
				significant amount of work to be done in order to help with contemplating a future 
				where numerous issues that make up for strongly establishing this new generation after 
				the Web 2.0 era of the internet must be resolved.

                          explorers may make use of virtual or augmented reality headsets in interacting with a 
                          three-dimensional streamline of world creations not limited by the space and time of

                    With this world consisting of seven layers, the ones that should be kept in mind 
                            with understanding it are the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The point of interaction between humans and a computer system.">human interface</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.">infrastructure</span>, and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to connect and exchange data.">Internet of Things (IoT)</span>. 
                            Regarding the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The point of interaction between humans and a computer system.">human interface</span>, this layer is focused on sharing experiences between 
                            users of the world by helping to receive information useful in understanding the world 
                            through spatial computing, where the VR or AR headset can be used in visually 
                            understanding the digital space by associating it with the physical world. Adding onto 
                            <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The point of interaction between humans and a computer system.">human interface</span>, other layers such as the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.">infrastructure</span> are essential in improving 
                            network connection technologies by using <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The fifth generation of cellular networks, providing faster speeds and more reliable connections than previous generations.">5G</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The anticipated sixth generation of cellular networks, expected to provide even faster speeds and greater capacity than 5G.">6G</span>, which can help with reducing the 
                            congestion of network bandwidth. In finality, the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to connect and exchange data.">Internet of Things</span> is identified as a 
                            layer in combining and constructing a 3D user interface that can help to associate the 
                            physical world with the digital one by providing minimal effort for the user in making 
                            data-driven judgments that can assist organizations in understanding utilizing the 
                            platform, with specific mentions being virtual offices within the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality.">Metaverse</span> where 
                            companies may hold meetings. As these instances also require an actual environment 
                            that can be worked within using augmented reality technology, the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality.">Metaverse</span> may 
                            collect important data such as biometric psychography in order to measure user data 
                            emotions that are key in identifying concerns for privacy and data security, especially 
                            when it's within an algorithmic bias that functions outside of the physical world and is 
                            capable of identifying unintentional behavioral assumptions.

                    <p>
                      When it comes to improvements that the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality.">Metaverse</span> can make, especially when it makes 
                              use of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Unique digital assets that cannot be replicated or exchanged on a like-for-like basis, requiring specific standards and processes for their management and verification.">NFTs</span>, is to be able to provide an open-source space where users within a global 
                              community have an opportunity to suggest solutions that may allow others to move 
                              smoothly between various three-dimensional spaces in order to embody anything that 
                              involves an <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A graphical representation of a user in a virtual environment or cyberspace.">avatar</span> that is capable of sharing intercommunication experiences with 
                              others. Though this is yet to be an improvement by large organizations, especially that 
                              of Facebook which has mentioned the name at a multitude of times on social media, 
                              industry partners and experts agree that such an ambitious concept requires a 
                              significant amount of work to be done in order to help with contemplating a future 
                              where numerous issues that make up for strongly establishing this new generation after 
                              the Web 2.0 era of the internet must be resolved.
