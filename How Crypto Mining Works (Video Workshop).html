							<br>
							In a digital realm of endless possibilities, Satoshi Nakamoto unveiled a revolutionary network,
							<br> 
							reshaping wealth accumulation.  Daring developers, armed with servers and GPUs, delved into this new
							<br> 
							frontier, embarking on a life-altering adventure.  Momentum surged, driven by third-party applications
							<br> 
							and industry giants like Hut 8, Marathon Digital, and Riot Blockchain.  With courage and energy coursing
							<br> 
							through their veins, miners wielded GPUs, SSDs, and the powerful heart of operations, ASICs.  Navigating a
							<br> 
							complex web of transactions, every move was calculated, every step a risk in pursuit of treasure.  Guided
							<br> 
							by the SHA-256 algorithm, they forged a secure chain against the winds of change.  From Bitcoin to Ethereum,
							<br> 
							they claimed their prizes, navigating treacherous terrain where values soared and plummeted.  The ancient
							<br> 
							Merkle tree wove a web of safety, guarding against disruptors seeking chaos.  In shadows, cryptojackers lurked,
							<br> 
							introducing malware to reap ill-gotten rewards, but heroes stood ready.  Cybersecurity experts like Sophos
							<br> 
							thwarted their nefarious plots, defending the realm.  Through trials, miners forged a path, expanding the
							<br> 
							digital realm, creating opportunities for the bold.  A tale of governance and earned rewards emerged, showing
							<br> 
							power belonged to the contributors.  The legend of Satoshi's Network lived on, a testament to those who dared
							<br> 
							to shape the future, forever echoing in the digital frontier.
							<br><br> 
							This week, we've decided to try something new and give you a short snippet
							<br>
							of a comic book format we're planning on creating for our workshops that will
							<br>
							replace video tutorials at certain time periods. Let us know what you think
							<br>
							on Discord!
