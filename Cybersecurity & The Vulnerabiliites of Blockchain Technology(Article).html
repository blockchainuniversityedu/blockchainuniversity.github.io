    <h1> Cybersecurity & The Vulnerabiliites of Blockchain Technology </h1>
    <h3> The Erebus Attack </h3>
    <br><br><br>
      <p>
        In this weeks workshop, we’ll discuss a disguised security vulnerability that most users of 
        blockchain technology may not be aware of from the get-go of using applications. As 
        we’ve covered topics such as making use of blockchain wallets, what is advised and not 
        recommended in the realm of managing securities behind digital assets as well as 
        finances, solely relies not just the general structure of the network, but also the people 
        who find loop holes in the system and take advantage of it.
        <br><br><br>
        Generally speaking, when a blockchain network is run, each user functions under a 
        specific node that consists of salt, identified by a hash number, and connected by the 
        previous user before it. It can be thought of as a branch of networks, each individually 
        following each other in the management of data resources that can work at specific 
        speeds. Generally speaking, a general transaction between two parties can work up to a 
        speed of 7 transactions per second, but thanks to applications such as IOTA everything 
        can be interconnected in an open-sourced data within a multi-sourced validation 
        system that’s open to the public.
        <br><br><br>
        The general message to see here, is that in the midst of developers and engineers 
        establishing a certain speed to the general performance of transactions, security 
        disruptions especially by third parties that hold a certain level of familiarity with the 
        network structure will rely on the vulnerabilities of the nodes in order to extract a large amount of personal data, at a large scale. This is where the Enebus attack takes place, a method for hackers to invade networks on the blockchain exchanging transactions either through an IOTA format or normally, in order to perform 51% attacks that can cripple portfolios of those managing their money in the system.
        <br><br><br>
        For some context, the term salt means a random storage of data secured through the 
        access of data, and is especially existent through hot storage that a person access by 
        the use of blockchain wallets. You may read more about this in our previous articles, but 
        considering our discussion is reliant on security atacks, the 51% vulnerability is 
        essentially a step in which hackers enter a pool of transactional nodes within the 
        network responsible for verifying an exchange in cryptocurrencies or digital assets, and 
        assume control over 51% of the ongoing processes. Generally speaking, the verificiation 
        of the currencies and assets within the network is called blockchain mining, and is 
        generally the term hackers want to hear when seeking the extraction of data at a 
        bolstering speed that invades protection of valued identifications at a high rate.
        <br><br><br>
        Now, since the alternative to using a hot storage to access personal information within 
        blockchain wallets can be varied depending on the activitiy you’re involved in, cold 
        storage methods are more or less recommended since ISPs will not be required to 
        access the same level of information. Generally speaking, despite the way the network is 
        built under a decentralized format for the freedom of the user, cold storages branch to 
        various solutions that uphold value for those who are simply seeking to perform day-to-
        day purchases and investments. Some of the branches of cold storage access methods 
        are L2s (Layer 2 Solutions) as well as sidechains. Since the speed and scale of 
        transactions is what attracts the hackers to perform the 51% attack, cold storage 
        security solutions works like layers to an onion. You have Layer-1 which is the main 
        blockchain system itself, where Layer-2 serves as a way to increase higher transaction 
        output by creating a third-party protocol that reduces the cost of making the exchanges 
        as well as enhances speed. Because nodes are essentially functioning under hash 
        numbers with security addresses, a set of them within an IOTA smart contract protocol 
        work under the L2 layer solution as it’s on-chain, which mentioned from before in our 
        first article, is essentially a set of transactions that take place within the blockchain.
        <br><br><br>
        A lot of the terms mentioned here, off-chain or on-chain, work under the main network 
        whereas a separate chain may exist, called the sidechain. The sidechain works in parallel 
        to the core of the onion so to speak, as it’s an extra strain of the blockchain that serves 
        as an offline way for digital assets to be exchanged. As of right now, offline storages are 
        the best way to combat the 51% attacks, but since hackers are clever with finding 
        alternative loop holes and methods considering that the security behind the technology 
        is still in the development stage, algorithms in the blockchain network vulnerable to the 
        security intrusion can be susceptibl to Sybil attacks as well. As we’ll eventually go over 
        the protection against identity fraud in further workshops with the help of applications, 
        a preview into the ongoing problems is through the Sybil attacks, where a hacker may 
        create numerous fake identities on the network that can be easily forgone if not 
        carefully seen by the party interacting with them for a transaction. Generally speaking, 
        these hackers find a way to take advantage of the hot storage access to networks by 
        making use of invalid private keys and falsely tampering with them so that the identity 
        is created. This is usually done so when other users do not make use of two-factor 
        authentication in order to protect their personal credentials, and therefore either have 
        their L1 or L2 addresses misconstrued with other users, creating a third-party mixup that 
        can disrupt the speed of numerous exchanges taking place.
        <br><br><br>
        Now you might be wondering, how can someone’s personal information get into a 
        third-party mixup with other hackers? To simply put, because the verifications of 
        exchanges in the network rely on smart contracts, a simple flaw in the coding next to 
        the lack of having 2FA over your accounts can create irreversible intrusions that will help 
        the hacker establish control over your network. Though, in the opposite direction, if a 
        smart contract is fully secured without defects in the code, it is simply unbreachable by 
        the hacker. Either way, enabling two-factor authentification, will not only prevent long-
        term attacks but also help you privately secure transactions while smoothly keeping 
        tracking of how your data is managed.
        <br><br><br>
        Next to the surface level attacks that can happen at any point in a busy network of 
        blockchain transactions, some of the minor ones that are also figured to be equally 
        damageable towards how users manage their portfolios is the short address attack and 
        race attack. To put it into Layman’s terms, the short address attack is specifically notable 
        in how Ethereum is exchanged under the ERC-20 standard, at which a hacker is capable 
        of manipulating the data behind a smart contract within the Ethereum network in order 
        to make it include data than was sent. On average, the term ‘short address’ in this 
        special instance implies that the address behind the smart contract is shortened so that 
        instead of a 20 byte-long string of numbers, it is shortened in order for the intruder to 
        receive or send more ETH tokens than usual. It is essentially a form of deceptive hacking 
        within the ERC-20 mainframe, which must be taken note of when managing such a 
        vastly used cryptocurrencies. Similar to this, the other instance is the race attack, which 
        expands beyond ETH but returns to the disruption of smart contract security in a busy 
        onchain network. To simply put, in a race attack, a hacker with multiple computing 
        systems can create two transactions at the same time for each user in the network by 
        establishing the initial exchange between a digital asset and the payment for it, where 
        multiple users will accept the same payment for their property without a proper 
        confirmation, leading to the hacker receiving the asset and their initial payment as the 
        exchange was not verified. The major reason for this attack, is simply because one of the 
        parties in the exchange does not await confirmation for the payment, creating theft of 
        property that cannot always be combatted through minting since once the attack has 
        happened, the hacker may have a fake identity that will make them uneasy to track 
        down.
        <br><br><br>
        By now, within a large or small scale, you have learned the major tweaks that a hacker 
        can perform towards a network in order to merit from the existing loopholes that those 
        on the opposite side of the transaction simply become a victim to experiencing. One of 
        the core reasons as to why this is an ongoing issues that hasn’t exactly established on a 
        core solution, is that enough security habits are not demonstrated for users to keep in 
        mind of when investing their own personal finances into the technology for a possible 
        return. Next to awaiting confirmation when a security intrusion takes place, enabling 
        two-factor authentication, the deeper issues involve a lack of communication and trust, 
        a problem with application development that can range between hundreds if not 
        thousands of developers largely involving code defects, and last but not least the early 
        stage of smart contracts crossing paths in an on-chain or off-chain set of nodes.
        <br><br><br>
        If you read our previous article on the contribution of blockchain technology to various 
        industries such as music, applications such as Audius avoid the aforementioned errors 
        by creating a space for users to purchase their private cryptocurrency, allowing them to 
        take full control over a specific node in order to secure smart contract exchanges, which 
        is a method effective in preventing 51% attacks by hackers, as the user assumes 
        decentralized governance over a part of the crypto-based set of nodes rather than 
        entirely relying on third-party sources that may not always be effective especially with 
        the state of how an L1 or L2 address can be tampered with by any security intruder. 
        Altogether, as this doesn’t just apply to the Web 3.0 space but Web 2.0 as well, always 
        be sure to set the right authentications towards your accounts, and maintain a certain 
        level of awareness over the businesses you trust your data with, as not all of them can 
        be trusted which can be partially exemplified by our article covering the downfall of 
        Silicon Valley Bank.

					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="Digital tools used to manage cryptocurrencies and interact with blockchain networks." >blockchain wallets</span> can be varied depending on the activity you’re involved in, <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Offline storage methods that keep digital assets or cryptocurrencies offline, disconnected from the internet." >cold

					create numerous fake identities on the network that can be easily forgone if not 
					carefully seen by the party interacting with them for a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of transferring assets or information between parties." >transaction</span>. Generally speaking, 
					these <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hackers</span> find a way to take advantage of the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An online storage system for cryptocurrencies that is connected to the internet." >hot storage</span> access to networks by 
					making use of invalid <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A code or string of characters used to access cryptocurrency holdings." >private keys</span> and falsely tampering with them so that the identity

        </p>

        <p>
            Now you might be wondering, how can someone’s <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Information specific to an individual, such as name, address, or contact details." >personal information</span> get into a 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="A situation where personal information is mixed up or mistaken with that of other parties." >third-party mixup</span> with other <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hackers</span>? To simply put, because the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Confirmation or validation processes carried out on transactions within the network." >verifications</span> of 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of exchanging assets or information between parties." >exchanges</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A system of interconnected computers or devices." >network</span> rely on <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code." >smart contracts</span>, a simple flaw in the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of writing or programming instructions for a computer." >coding</span> next to 
					the lack of having <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A security method that requires two different forms of identification for access." >2FA</span> over your accounts can create <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Unauthorized and irreversible entries into a system or network." >irreversible intrusions</span> that will help 
					the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hacker</span> establish <span class="tooltip" data-definition="To gain power or authority over a system or network." >control</span> over your network. Though, in the opposite direction, if a 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code." >smart contract</span> is fully secured without <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Mistakes or errors in the code." >defects</span> in the code, it is simply unbreachable by 
					the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hacker</span>. Either way, enabling <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A security method that requires two different forms of identification for access." >two-factor authentication</span>, will not only prevent long-
					term attacks but also help you privately secure <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of transferring assets or information between parties." >transactions</span> while smoothly keeping 
					tracking of how your <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Information specific to an individual, such as name, address, or contact details." >data is managed</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next to the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Attacks occurring at the surface level, easily accessible or not requiring extensive permissions." >surface level attacks</span> that can happen at any point in a busy network of 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of recording transactions or information in a digital ledger." >blockchain transactions</span>, some of the minor ones that are also figured to be equally 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="Causing harm or destruction." >damageable</span> towards how users manage their <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A collection of financial assets owned by an individual or organization." >portfolios</span> is the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An attack that exploits vulnerabilities in a system to manipulate data." >short address attack</span> and 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="An attack where multiple actions are initiated at the same time to exploit system vulnerabilities." >race attack</span>. To put it into <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An explanation using simple or everyday language." >Layman’s terms</span>, the short address attack is specifically notable 
					in how <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A decentralized platform that runs smart contracts." >Ethereum</span> is exchanged under the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain." >ERC-20 standard</span>, at which a hacker is capable 
					of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Unauthorized alteration or modification of data in a system to achieve a specific outcome." >manipulating the data</span> behind a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code." >smart contract</span> within the Ethereum network in order 
					to make it include data than was sent. On average, the term ‘short address’ in this 
					special instance implies that the address behind the smart contract is shortened so that 
					instead of a 20 byte-long string of numbers, it is shortened in order for the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="An unauthorized attempt to gain control over digital assets or data." >intruder</span> to 
					receive or send more <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network." >ETH tokens</span> than usual. It is essentially a form of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Tricking or misleading by manipulating information or code." >deceptive hacking</span> 
					within the ERC-20 <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A structure or core system." >mainframe</span>, which must be taken note of when managing such a 
					vastly used <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security." >cryptocurrencies</span>. Similar to this, the other instance is the race attack, which 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="Spreads across a wider range or to various aspects." >expands</span> beyond ETH but returns to the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Interruption or disturbance of smart contract security in a busy on-chain network." >disruption</span> of smart contract security in a busy 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="A series of connected computers or systems." >onchain network</span>. To simply put, in a race attack, a hacker with multiple <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Systems or devices capable of performing computations." >computing systems</span> can create two transactions at the same time for each user in the network by 
					establishing the initial exchange between a digital asset and the payment for it, where 
					multiple users will accept the same payment for their property without a proper 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="The act of verifying or validating an action or transaction." >confirmation</span>, leading to the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hacker</span> receiving the asset and their initial payment as the 
					exchange was not verified. The major reason for this attack, is simply because one of the 
					parties in the exchange does not await confirmation for the payment, creating <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The act of taking someone else's property unlawfully." >theft of 
					property</span> that cannot always be combatted through <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of creating new cryptocurrency tokens." >minting</span> since once the attack has 
					happened, the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hacker</span> may have a fake identity that will make them uneasy to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Locate or trace." >track 
					down</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            By now, within a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Scope or extent, whether broad or limited." >large or small scale</span>, you have learned the major tweaks that a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A person who gains unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hacker</span> 
					can perform towards a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A system of interconnected computers or devices." >network</span> in order to <span class="tooltip" data-definition="To deserve or be entitled to." >merit from</span> the existing <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Weaknesses or gaps in a system, often used by people for their advantage." >loopholes</span> that those 
					on the opposite side of the transaction simply become a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A person who suffers from a harmful action or crime." >victim</span> to experiencing. One of 
					the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Central or fundamental reasons." >core reasons</span> as to why this is an ongoing issue that hasn’t exactly established on a 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="A fundamental or definitive solution." >core solution</span>, is that enough <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Recurring behaviors that promote security." >security habits</span> are not demonstrated for <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who use a service or product." >users</span> to keep in 
					mind of when investing their own <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Personal monetary resources." >personal finances</span> into the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Technological tools or systems." >technology</span> for a possible 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="The act of getting back or receiving something in exchange." >return</span>. Next to awaiting <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of verifying or validating an action or transaction." >confirmation</span> when a security intrusion takes place, enabling 
					<span class="tooltip" data-definition="A security method that requires two different forms of identification for access." >two-factor authentication</span>, the deeper issues involve a lack of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The imparting or exchanging of information." >communication</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Firm belief in the reliability, truth, or ability of someone or something." >trust</span>, 
					a problem with <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The process of creating software applications." >application development</span> that can range between hundreds if not 
					thousands of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who write, test, and maintain computer programs." >developers</span> largely involving <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Mistakes or errors in the code." >code defects</span>, and last but not least the early 
					stage of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code." >smart contracts</span> crossing paths in an <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Transactions or data processing that occurs on the main blockchain." >on-chain</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Transactions or data processing that occurs off the main blockchain." >off-chain</span> set of <span class="tooltip" data-definition="A point of connection within a network." >nodes</span>.

					is a method effective in <span class="tooltip" data-definition="The act of preventing or stopping something from occurring." >preventing</span> 51% attacks by <span class="tooltip" data-definition="People who gain unauthorized access to systems or networks." >hackers</span>, as the user assumes
