        <h1> How TO Run a Business w/ Crypto </h1>
				<h3> Capital Management </h3>
      <p>
        Up until this very point, the various articles we’ve written were meant to signify a 
					significant development in how blockchain technology interacts with the real-world, on 
					a fundamental level. From diverse applications merging with physical hardware in order 
					to develop an everlasting way for people to manage their finances, we’ve also learned 
					thus far that the teams taking place in making this happen are looking to arrive towards 
					an agenda with a different future of the merging technologies that will only advance 
					through blockchain technology.

      <p>
        For this particular topic, we’ll be discussing a subject in the range of investment 
        management (IM), at which capital through leadership and the transformation of asset 
        management businesses in the world of blockchain technology, is creating a major 
        expansion for how we bridge together merging technologies which help to address and 
        resolve current challenges for the adaption of companies in the future. Now, as we’ve 
        discussed before, as much as capital comes in different forms, how we digitally spread 
        its data safely with the help of applications on behalf of the users requests in making 
        transactions, is still a significant challenge, something that requires a great level 
        processing speed as well as the issuing of employment for those who are capable of 
        understanding and deploying research on the commercial implementation, cost 
        reduction and technological configurations of the systems. In the case that there might 
        be confusion, IMs are typically taken for the role of managing investment portfolios on 
        behalf of clients. We cannot forget that this is a title for a white collar profession that 
        some may label themselves as from the get-go, as some do in fact market themselves 
        to gain the ‘false’ sense of trust with your finances, promising to manage them in the 
        long-run. We’ve seen this example before through the FTX incident explained in a 
        previous workshop series 'How NOT to Run a Business w/ Crypto: The FTX Incident’, at 
        which various elements such as putting in place not just developers but also governing 
        bodies of the network-based operations, will only strengthen the security of these 
        portfolio management applications.

        <button class="lock-button" onclick="toggleLock(this)">🖍️</button>  
      <p>
        Generally speaking, IMs are typically known for managing the portfolios under a 
					discretionary or non-discretionary basis, meaning that the traditional investments their 
					clients make are generally sustained through a process of assigning securities to various 
					types of accounts, and overlooking trades on behalf of a financial advisor. Blockchain 
					technology strives to change this narrative by shifting the procedure to a network-
					driven model, which can create greater possibilities for efficiency, accountability, and 
					innovation in the financial markets, especially under the line of US shareholders 
					servicing major companies. Of course, without the core structures that make up of how 
					blockchain technology facilitates transactions such as smart contracts, companies simply 
					are not capable of taking advantage of the increasing processing speeds of the network 
					as well as how it contributes to the amount of transactions taking place without these 
					factors, hence why it’s important to also highlight the way IMs are going to collaborate 
					with the technology to reassure the job market will be making use of intermediation.

      <p>
        In addition to the main usages of blockchain technology that we’ve covered thus far, 
        the mergence of financial markets and their curators with the is only thriving to bring 
        disintermediation to some form of establishment. What this means is, instead of gaining 
        central permission of authority on behalf of financial institutions, IMs can successfully 
        create direct contact and communication with clients, taking on the role of reshaping 
        the labor landscape, which may have disadvantages such as job losses. Although the 
        procedure of the general transition is far more complex than explained on an average 
        white paper, there is already a common method that developers and users of various 
        professions within industries is making use of to make sure the supply chain of 
        contractual activities with verification limits, are to be kept ongoing without operational 
        deficiencies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box blur" id="box5">
      <div class="arrow">

      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <button class="lock-button" onclick="toggleLock(this)">🖍️</button>
      <p>
        To explain this method, it would be essential in using an example of already existing 
					companies. When an average company releases a product, whether that’s food or self-
					driving cars, the shelving process on these items are specifically meant to be monitored 
					by the conduction of an audit or the inspection of inventory. Referring back to our 
					previous article on how the buyer and seller go in the process of exchanging a property, 
					and must meet the minimum requirement of an inspection, the general landscape of 
					how IMs manage portfolios depending on this certain type of capital and plan on 
					expanding it for the client must undergo the same process. Of course, this can come 
					with its disadvantages, such as having the inability to understand how certain items 
					reach a specific expiration date within the supply chain (referring to food supply), for 
					which on a significant level can lead to an inconsistent allocation of the same products 
					to stores, a weak set of patterns towards customer demand, as well as an unstable 
					rotation of the appropriate shelving or products. Regardless, this still helps with driving 
					a verification process that may instantly apply to a wide spectrum of goods and services 
					which doesn’t always have to overlap with the focused world of finance.

      <p>
        In addition to this regulatory method, it could also be safe to say there are specific 
					requirements taking place to also combat financial mismanagement within this field. As 
					discussed previously, equivalent to the FATF (Financial Action Task Force), the 
					implementation of the Blockchain Task Force as well as other documentations such as 
					KYC (“Know Your Customer) and AML (“Anti-Money Laundering), play a bigger role in 
					making users fulfill the right obligations in making sure transactions between users and 
					companies run safely. Although this can be both time-consuming and costly for some 
					people, considering that LLCs have to be set in place as well to protect against violation 
					of property rights (as mentioned in our previous article regarding Propy), it is simply the 
					best way to adapt securities which are token-based and have a particular cycle of 
					governance placed on them. With direct communication also comes real-time access to 
					how the client receives and exchanges crucial information, which is especially important 
					for blockchain startups as they can benefit from how this feature itself can empower the 
					way institutions and other relevant organization identify suspicious behavior from an 
					instant.

        Since we have already mentioned clients and users a number of times, it is important to 
        also cover a particular set of people which will later be explained in depth for future 
        workshops, at which this group is known as “data miners”. In specific, with the use of 
        graphics processors and computing power, data miners attempt to implement their own 
        processing speed in order to track existing cryptocurrency tokens attached to IPs 
        (Intellectual Property), or any other baseline applications for the sake of profit. A reason 
        for this mention, is that the opportunities given to miners on behalf of this process is 
        that they will simply be able to grasp the increasing traffic of the networks expansion by 
        having a clear vision of developing marketplaces. These avenues placed upon not just 
        the users but the miners amongst the populus, has already received a healthy amount 
        of investments, with the estimate amount taking up to 13 billion USD by ICOs (Initial 
        Coin Offerings) from the first half of 2018. A note will be made here, that Initial Coin 
        Offerings are essentially the entry level funding that the team behind the token receives 
        for the sake of raising supply and marketing the cryptocurrency itself by any means 
        necessary.

        In the current state of this development, there are already leading technology members 
					the world of DeFI that are understanding the potential of this new development, one of 
					them already being the founder of the popular cryptocurrency Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. 
					The core belief that Buterin holds over this technology, is that through the use of 
					holding governance over specific nodes within the blockchain network, the significance 
					in how applications will help to drive fluent portfolio management is far greater now 
					than ever before, though the overall encapsulation of the financial market which is 
					looking to be pushed in the future by blockchain technology, could mean that more 
					complex software will likely have difficulties with ensuring that security on behalf of 
					user-controlled and governance based systems will take place. Although defects in the 
					code of applications as part of this supply chain will also contribute to the 
					aforementioned difficulties, merits are likely to come towards resolving this issue due to 
					the sake of consistent large-scale financing, as the technology itself ever since its 
					creation in 2009 has received up to 1 billion$ when directed towards its corporate 
					counterparts, with already a 59% increase in investments of them if not more in the last 
					year, which can incentivize developers to drive groundbreaking solutions and new 
					features that will grow fluency in application development under the blockchain 
					protocols.

        As part of portfolio management is also the facilitation of bonds and mortgage-backed 
					securities, it is important to keep note that under all of the regulations and policies 
					mentioned before, loans must also be controlled and assessed by these IMs or financial 
					advisors in general. This typically works by making the loan itself offered by a group of 
					lenders, or a syndicate, hence providing funds for a borrower that is looking to manage 
					their own large project or even governmental organization. This is typically for sizable 
					corporations that may historically require a large budgeting limit, at which thanks to the 
					processing speed and direct communication between financial vendors on the 
					blockchain, the funding process for syndicate loans can be near-instantaneous. 
					Connecting back to the general idea of portfolio management, another major key to 
					making sure profits between trades and largely networked firms are utilized sufficiently, 
					is that they must maintain flexibility with the management of assets depending on how 
					much of the asset on a scale can be liquidized. In an “upstairs market” for example, at 
					which firms and institutional investors do not trade publicly on the stock market 
					especially upon a sizable portfolio, the securities made use of, can likely transition to the 
					blockchain networks as the key options of tradability without direct traceable contact is 
					available, especially for the sake of reducing costs of the trading activity itself.

        Overall, the transition being made within the blockchain network is only going to thrive 
					in serving not just the user but the conglomerates themselves seeking a decentralized 
					line of trading, which overall shares a safe space for not only communication between 
					these parties, but the ability to create a fluent stream of advisory boards within each 
					node that can take advantage of applications which contribute widely to industries built 
					on sustaining livelihoods of IMs and their involvements in capital management.
