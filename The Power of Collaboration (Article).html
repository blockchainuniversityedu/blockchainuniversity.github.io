        <h1> Collaboration On The Blockchain </h1>
				<h3> When Resilience Meets Innovation </h3>
      <p>
        <i>“I think the people from the [Ethereum] Foundation were not happy with what was going on at the DAO, even prior to the hack--Because they thought it was too early.”</i>

					Regarding the general sphere of how transactions are traded on the blockchain 
					network, there is no doubt in saying that cyber crimes are always a major issue that is to 
					be addressed, especially after the fact that so many roles take place within the 
					technology that aren’t just newcomers on the platform. As I’ve covered flaws in 
					cybersecurity from the past, it is important to emphasize that major events from the past 
					that have intruded on the safety of these transactions have defined the great lengths 
					that a collaborative community has gone towards making sure such problems were not 
					to be repeated again.

        In this situation, that one event which completely adjusted the course of blockchain 
        history was something called the DAO attack. For those who didn't read the past 
        workshop about the history behind Ethereum, this particular event created a pause in 
        the development of an application in particular that would expand upon the expansion and 
        financial eligibility of Ethereum to the rest of the world. The term DAO, stands for Decentralized 
        Autonomous Organization, which in 2016, was a method at which governance could be implemented 
        on behalf of owners of a stake in a cryptocurrency, in order to adapt ‘Proof of Stake’ methods 
        on applications such as Ethereum, and to also narrow the maximum security of validation for 
        cryptocurrency miners. But in this article, we won’t be explaining that, but instead focusing on 
        what led to the initial downfall and meticulous rise of the DAO that brings it the power it works under today.

      <p>
        As source code is the most important part of the cycle at which anything related to 
					blockchain technology functions properly, this particular event fell victim to defects in the 
					programming of the DAO process, ultimately creating a major financial loss that would 
					test the feasibility of Ethereum as a yet, early cryptocurrency at the time. Justifiably, as 
					much as the DAO concept was as early as the advantageous structure of Ethereum 
					itself, this event in particular led to a security flaw that would importantly change the 
					entire direction of how currencies were to work with applications.

      <p>
        In order to put it into a simple explanation, when it came to Ethereum, the specific 
        security intrusion came when a hacker decided to take advantage of two important and 
        relatively basic functions within the code. Since there’s a receiver and sender within an 
        average transaction, in this particular case, there was the coding functions of receive() 
        and withdraw(). Since a transaction, without the help of smart contracts of course, 
        cannot work without this programming logic, it was figured at the time that you could 
        corrupt the ‘calldata’ of the process in order keep withdrawing money from a currency 
        without the balance of the users financial account changing.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box blur" id="box5">
      <div class="arrow">
        <button class="up-arrow" onclick="scrollToTop()" disabled> 👈 </button>
        <button class="down-arrow" onclick="scrollToBottom()"> 👉 </button>
      </div>
      <span class="paragraph-indicator">Paragraph 5 of 12</span>
      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <button class="lock-button" onclick="toggleLock(this)">🖍️</button>
      <p>
        For clarification, ‘calldata’ is the enacted storage base of the currency, or a collection of 
					four data deposits  of code that allows two functions within the code to communicate. An 
					example could be that, I send someone ETH in exchange for a piece of digital property 
					they agreed to sell to myself as the buyer, at which the calldata allows me to send 
					through the currency amount within the conditions that a fallback() function doesn’t take 
					place, at which the code and the financial data passed through a smart contract 
					produces an error code if all the correct functions do not serve their roles in ensuring 
					that a secure and validated buying and selling procedure takes place.
      </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="box blur" id="box6">
      <div class="arrow">

      <div class="paragraph-container">
        <button class="lock-button" onclick="toggleLock(this)">🖍️</button>
      <p>
        Now, the reason as to why there’s two core functions, receive() and withdraw() within 
					the code is because a particular individual had to have withdrawn finances from their 
					supposed accounts in order to ensure that the transaction of paying and receiving a 
					digital commodity took place. The unfortunate circumstance here was that a re-entry 
					attack took place, at which a hacker disguising themselves as a role within the network 
					such as an investor, made sure that they could consistently withdraw vitalized currency 
					money from multiple accounts at once without a specific receive() function taking place. 
					Essentially, this person or group of people kept withdrawing money without letting the 
					system know that there wasn’t a receiving end, which usually sparks a fallback function 
					to take place.

      <p>
        Frankly, due to malicious code or a package that was installed into the network to begin 
        with, this event had not taken place. All of these activities took place within the DAO 
        smart contracts that ETH had first adapted at the time, leading to a major repercussion 
        towards the security of millions of users at the time. As a chain must be formed at which 
        users interact and validate each other's data, this malicious activity led to an inactive 
        range of blocks, as thought of like a set of dominos that are falling behind each other 
        synchronously. Altogether, the consequence of the event led to 5% of the total supply of 
        ETH to be depleted, or in equivalence, 150$ million worth of the currency itself.

        To remain specific before I discuss what the solution to the issue was, I will mention that 
					the functions mentioned for the DAO-controlled smart contracts at the time were written 
					under a programming language called Solidity. In order to solve the problem, the team 
					behind Ethereum including that of the founder Vitalik Buterin himself, was to essentially 
					write a fork under Ethereum that would completely reset the entire history of the 
					currency itself, setting the value of it back to 0 and restarting all the work and 
					investments put into making it work to begin with. This would essentially solve the initial 
					withdrawing glitch the hacker would take advantage of, at which the withdraw() function 
					would repeat itself without any indication of a receiving end existing from a different user 
					holding a contract that would otherwise complete the transaction itself.

        Other thoughts were to offer money to crypto miners within the network up to 100 ETH 
					or even BTC, in order to stop them continuing their operations within the network, to 
					make sure that absence in the network would lead to isolating the hackers unchanging 
					balance. Since neither of these solutions were to work, one major addition was left to 
					make ETH progress to the next level, and that was through a method called forking. In 
					this case, the hackers were given a choice, at which they must adapt to a soft fork of the 
					currency, which essentially means replicating the code and modifying it to split the 
					complete user base into people who want to stick to an older version of the system, 
					versus the users who want to move to a newer version instead. It’s like Microsoft asking 
					an average PC user to upgrade to Windows 11, whereas some would like to solely 
					focus on continuing to use Windows 10.

        As this was not a valued solution, since the core use of the DAO contract would still 
					exist for the hacker who found the glitch to begin with, the only alternative was to 
					produce a hard fork, at which all users of the network were to switch to a brand new 
					network at which the initial smart contract was to be duplicated, hence the birth of 
					Ethereum Classic. To simply put, all users of the network would have to temporarily 
					remain within an inactive chain, in order to upgrade to the smart contract method of 
					Ethereum Classic, to continue mining and trading the core cryptocurrency.

        This adaption to the solution remained highly successful, at which the soft fork method 
        would only help to censor existing transactions on the network and to remove openness 
        and visibility for those trading their finances, and to instead embark a hard fork that 
        would completely remove censorship and introduce a new way at which overarching 
        control of a central organization wouldn’t exist. Since the adaption of the hard fork 
        method, the inactive chain which discontinued transactions past the 1,920,000th block 
        within the network on 2016/07/20, would be continued under the Ethereum Classic 
        contract format. The real importance of this development was that, one fault in the code 
        of a major currency gave perspectives to the community that the most urgent events in 
        the digitalized safety of people’s finances may always lead to the quickly initiated 
        solutions of a team that proves both collaborative and ambitious towards their project. If 
        ETC was not introduced at the rush of events, ETH would not exist today as a moving 
        currency that revitalized what is now a custom path of transactional activity that drives 
        how people interact with their information on a day-to-day basis, and surely wouldn’t 
        have been done so without perseverance of the users passionate about the currency.

        written by Solidity means, to the overall course of events that followed before, during,
