				<h1> Video Games on the Blockchain </h1>
				<h3> The GameFi Scene, Explained. </h3>
				<br>
                  <p>
					<i>"Gaming does not need blockchain; blockchain needs gaming. Blockchain will only see mass adoption
					<br>
					and mass application once it provides significant value to the video gaming ecosystem."</i>
					<br>
					- Josh Chapman, <b>Managing Partner of Konvoy Ventures</b>
					<br><br><br>
					In previous workshops, I’ve discussed the generational standard of how the financial capabilities 
					of blockchain technology tends to merge with other industries in order to bridge connections that 
					are currently existing outside of the decentralized world. 
					<br><br><br>
					For this particular case, I will be discussing one special instance of this that was discussed 
					mostly up front within the media, but not as much in detail as I will be doing today. As 
					free-to-play video games as of 2023 take up about 80% of the market today, due to the 
					constantly expanding world of payments of microtransactions, newer versions of this model 
					have arrived to the world of blockchain technology through GameFi. 
					<br><br><br>
					As the term suggests, GameFi is simply the merge of words ‘Gaming’ and ‘Finance’, yet how it 
					strives to expand upon the way users interact with entertainment regarding personal finance is 
					still relatively a new concept that is not common to the media just yet. 
					<br><br><br>
					Now, in the past, you may have heard of the subjects of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a format 
					at which assets are created and distributed to users in return for cryptocurrency tokens as a 
					reward. Usually, since this it out of a traditional way fo exchanging financial resources, a lot of 
					this activity takes place in the ‘grey market’, which is the area where unofficial stocks or assets 
					are traded until they appear on the NASDAQ. 
					<br><br><br>
					This is where some of the major platforms come into play, at which these titles follow through a 
					method of interoperability in the application of blockchain technology to video games, at which 
					something called cross-chain technology takes place. I will expand upon this in future 
					workshops, but to simply put, this allows a flexible transfer of managed data between external 
					systems that can get a hold of the DLT (distributed ledger technology) in order to make use of 
					smart contracts in the process when checking verifiability. 
					<br><br><br>
					This paradigm of GameFi helps to bring a new perspective of platforming entertainment to those 
					who are seeking to earn a reward in return for the distribution of their creative outlets. Since the 
					expansion of the network thanks partially to crypto miners, GameFi can range from the US to 
					the continent of Asia, as well as countries such as India that are well known for adopting the 
					blockchain itself. 
					<br><br><br>
					The key thing to note here, is the magnitude of collaboration it takes for such a platform to come 
					together, with an extension of that according to a study being that investing into GameFi through 
					time spent on titles as well as the return in currency ranging within three elements, these being 
					the active notion of the community for about 67% of the process, the team running the 
					application being that of 51%, and finally the gameplay aspect which is 51% of the process.
					<br><br><br>
					Keep in mind, these statistics are all separate, mainly because several existing platforms focus 
					on these different key aspects at a time. Notable platforms include Decentraland, or THE SANDBOX, 
					all creative outlets of experimentation that are yet in early development to define the 
					next generation of technology from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. 
					<br><br><br>
					Now, you may be asking a key question, what kind of technology through all of these factors 
					should be made use of to make this investment, even remotely possible? To simply put, what 
					takes place is a tokenized asset system, at which ownership over in-game assets typical of what 
					is seen in a game you’d play (ex. Weapons, pets, food items, etc.) can exist under the 
					pre-existing notion that the buying and selling of this will take place through a special method 
					called the ‘atomic swap’. 
					<br><br><br>
					The ‘atomic swap’ makes use of cross-chain technology by allowing the logging of sales within 
					the blockchain, by taking the assets or tokens in question that are being traded and instead of 
					transferring it to another blockchain, you are removing it and generating the equivalent of it to 
					another blockchain. What this does altogether, is create parallel blockchains through the earlier 
					mentioned cross-chain technology, in order to remove the reliance on a centralized entity to take 
					ownership of the token, and to fulfill online markets that want to run token exchanges in order to 
					enhance interoperability within flexible systems that favor automation by adapting smart 
					contracts on different channels of the blockchain at once. 
					<br><br><br>
					All of this technology at once, allows a global trade of assets regardless of what country or ISP 
					is being made use of in that moment, creating a ‘top-down’ approach to how customers want to 
					meet their needs towards video game companies versus that of centralized corporations that 
					could favor profits over community renditions at the interest of investors. Remember, this is 
					done thanks to the business models modest shift from play-to-play (P2P) to a free-to-play model 
					(F2P) model that engages people’s time over a higher chance of spending money on asset in 
					the long-run. 
					<br><br><br>
					In order to further emphasize on the projects extending from this topic, I will mention a particular 
					Web 3.0 game that more or less makes use of these models, which as a side note, make use of 
					a trilemma that takes three factors that define the success of such a project, and prioritizes two 
					factors of it that makes up for the statistics I mentioned earlier, these being a combination of 
					decentralization, scalability and security, at which two of the three chosen will define the 
					platforms differently from one another. 
					<br><br><br>
					The game I’ll be mentioning goes by the name, ‘My Neighborhood Alice’, which makes use of 
					the F2P model and as an extension, uses the play-to-earn model as mentioned earlier to foster 
					a healthy environment where virtual lands can be built, creating a game economy with direct 
					communications in order to invest time into the game to both purchase lands, and incorporate 
					assets on top of it. To be more specific, think of it like a game of Monopoly, but rather you’re 
					creating the lands mentioned throughout the game, and are openly sharing it within a DeFi 
					space to open financial opportunities. 
					<br><br><br>
					Going back to the direct communication aspect of the game, players must take on the 
					responsibility on being vigilant about how they interact with players, especially considering that 
					a lot of the code that makes up of the game itself is publicly disclosed and can divide 
					communities on what the rules of the game should be, which is generally displayed under the 
					game’s white paper. 
					<br><br><br>
					As you can tell, the general scene of GameFi requires the sacrifice of different factors that affect 
					the team working on the project and how it translates to the network, versus the toll it can take 
					on the community as well. On one hand, you can reduce computational power distributed 
					across the functioning of transactions to save energy costs, but that would raise concerns about 
					security, so altogether based off of the trilemma, the equilibrium relies on whether or not you 
					want your platform in association with the blockchain network to be ‘cheap, good, or fast’. 
					<br><br><br>
					As these projects are still early in development, one other concern is that they are not regulated 
					by the government or with any policy putting restrictions on theft, as the next major problem next 
					to security vulnerabilities is theft itself. With NFTs in particular, the Web 2.0 generation may 
					easily download or screenshot digital work available otherwise on the Web 3.0 platform, unless 
					they are known or discovered by the owner of the property itself. 
					<br><br><br>
					Altogether, this is an investment worth making for the future, but currently a risk that is better 
					taken within a small circle at which properties are supported amongst people you know. 
					<br><br>

With <span class="tooltip" data-definition="NFTs: Non-fungible tokens representing ownership of unique items." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">NFTs</span> in particular, the Web 2.0 generation may easily download or screenshot digital work available otherwise on the Web 3.0 platform, unless they are known or discovered by the owner of the property itself.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Altogether, this is an <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Investment: Committing money or capital in order to gain profitable returns." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">investment</span> worth making for the <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Future: Time that is yet to come." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">future</span>, but currently a <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Risk: Potential of losing something of value." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">risk</span> that is better taken within a small <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Circle: A group of people with shared interests or purposes." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">circle</span> at which <span class="tooltip" data-definition="Properties: Assets or items owned." data-videos="Video1, Video2, Video3">properties</span> are supported amongst people you know.
