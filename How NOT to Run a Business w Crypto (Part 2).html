                    “In the past, you had to be the FBI… I think a lot of influencers, banks and governments 
					don’t realize how much the blockchain is going to change the way we report things.”
					– Stephen Findeisen (also known as Coffeezilla)
					<br><br><br>
					In previous articles, we discussed several arrays of topics covering that of cybersecurity 
					and the common intrusions that take place by a consistent set of individuals called 
					“hackers”. Today, branching from the network to the real world, we’ll be discussing 
					the kind that does not hold power over loopholes of the network, but so much controls a 
					simple yet major flaw in the economy consisting of coins which aren’t trustworthy, for 
					which these are called celebrities and influencers.
					<br><br><br>
					If you’ve read our article about the Silicon Valley Bank crisis that took place a while back, 
					or how to invest using a blockchain wallet, you’d understand that the surface layer of all 
					major risks to investing personal finances towards cryptocurrency goes by spread of 
					word. With the general infrastructure and economy behind social media, the influential 
					people tend to drive the cause and effect of the system, leading to all kinds of 
					misunderstandings as well as misinformation that may affect millions of peoples lives.
					<br><br><br>
					Generally speaking, the level of profit promised by cryptocurrency firms to these 
					influencers, who fall victim to only knowing the subtle yet limited definition of 
					cryptocurrency, agree to promote a certain kind of currency of the firm by performing 
					something called a rug-pull. As it’s imagined, when users are sitting on their personal 
					finances ready to make an investment, their favorite influencers are subject to convince 
					their fanbase to make the deposit for the currency as they believe it will create a 
					promising portfolio. In full circle, the influencer and the personal investor are both given 
					little information about the currency, yet they’re both convinced by each other and of a 
					greater influence of the firm controlling the cryptocurrency, to call purchase of coins 
					and enforce a short-term response to the increase of the value of the token.
					<br><br><br>
					When it comes to investment, as we’ve covered before, it is important to invest an asset 
					such as cash into a coin that is supported by it (known in short words by what is called 
					“stablecoin”), as liquid is the major key to security especially in a volatile market. 
					Returning to the subject of celebrities, a rug pull takes place when shortly after the 
					spread of demand towards the cryptocurrency fluctuates, the value instantly falls down 
					which in turn created significant losses in finances of investors, returning the profits to 
					the owners and influencers of the currency. This instance has occurred on various 
					occasions, especially since the start of the pandemic, with the practice of transparency 
					and verifiability towards information getting bypassed since the era we currently live in 
					tends to include a downturn in major economic elements (housing affordability crisis, 
					healthcare, etc.). Examples of celebrities, who claimed to have been unaware of the 
					repercussions of their investments, can range anywhere from notable investor such as 
					Shark Tank celebrity Kevin O’Leary, to reality TV star Kim Kardashian, former basketball 
					player Shaqueill O’Neal, and finally the YouTuber who has fallen most for the 
					controversy Logan Paul.
					<br><br><br>
					It is important to compare the two kinds of celebrities in this case, since a rug pull 
					doesn’t necessarily have to mean promoting something in the short-term for long-term 
					financial effect that benefits only the influencer instead of the audience. Those who 
					have built a fanbase outside of social media, have participated in commercials on TV 
					which tends to reach an audience of millennials, whereas newer generations exposed to 
					the constant speed of information released through social media are prone to seeing 
					promotions every now and then not just through short posts but major projects. Key 
					examples of these projects are not just limited to hedge funds promising to manage 
					finances for you through the currency such as FTX, which we’ve covered in a previous 
					article in full is relatable for the observer.
					<br><br><br>
					For example, without naming too many of them as there’s enough already, I will give 
					the real-life scenario of a cryptocurrency investment campaign that had connected well 
					with a large audience, and that is Save the Kids. Initially operated by popular gaming 
					community FaZe Clan, the campaign intended to take people’s cryptocurrency 
					investments, and divert it towards providing resources to children in need. Promoted 
					through platforms such as Twitter and YouTube, various investors both personal and 
					corporate, put their finances into a pool at which right after the value of the currency 
					declined, making various of these key investments by the users rapidly decrease to the 
					point at which the organization responsible for the scheme was confronted. The key 
					thing to realize and understand here, is that all of these campaigns are not necessarily 
					run by built applications on the blockchain networks, or even cryptocurrencies that 
					serve as stablecoins, but is simply driven by the negative downside of stablecoins called 
					‘altcoins’. As the word suggests, they are alternative coins which aren’t Bitcoin or 
					Ethereum, and can be randomly generated at any point by one person or a group of 
					people without having to get permission by others for the needs of regulation. As we’ve 
					covered this concept in our workshops, especially one regarding the use of investing 
					with blockchain wallets, it is a major strategy for those who tend to use their influence 
					to not only spread of mouth, but also be paid to create false predictions of how much 
					the value will skyrocket for the short-term, since there are content creators on these 
					platforms claiming to be expert analysts and insiders of the market that can understand 
					if something is promised without correct information to back it up.
					<br><br><br>
					An interesting question that one may want to ask in this case is, after a large amount of 
					media turmoil takes place over these ‘pump-and-dump’ schemes (a separate term for 
					rug pulls), what is the most government authorities could do to make sure this does not 
					happen again. With what we’ve covered in our previous article, regarding how 
					decentralized platforms run applications that are closely linked with governmental laws 
					in the field of cybersecurity, there is no precisely direct way a government can enforce 
					greater regulations especially when they’re a singular office, apart from following the 
					mostly visible solution which is creating a lawsuit. This is the situation that the 
					cryptocurrency organization Ripple was approached by, after the SEC (Securities and 
					Exchange Commission) filed a lawsuit towards the company after having allegedly sold 
					a large supply of cryptocurrency by the name of XRP, a token we’ve mentioned in our 
					previous article that is used most importantly in applications sourcing user identity 
					protection. Of course, Ripple claimed to have done this under the belief that general 
					coins should not be held as a security, which is a notion that may apply to altcoins, but 
					strictly limits the potential of applications on the blockchain network.
					<br><br><br>
					Lawsuits, or claims to be specific involved in the security behind cryptocurrency is not 
					just limited to the government, but between organizations involved in opposite sides of 
					the spectrum of financial investing and security. For example, the key company that 
					drives promotion of stablecoins in the trading market, Binance, runs a charity that acts 
					as receiver of donations towards groups involved in benefitting those in need, at which 
					Save The Kids claimed to have donated 80,000$ of the benefits to from their liquidity 
					pool, though like a transaction taking place in a “race attack”, was not confirmed by 
					Binance themselves. At a grand scale, the miscommunication between cryptocurrency 
					token promoters and organizations running on security for individuals finances, as well 
					as how that will be combatted by way global powers in the near future may combat the 
					problem by creating solutions, will require patience due to the pace at which it’s difficult 
					to penalize developers who are simultaneously running these pump-and-dump 
					schemes while they’re overlapping with social media promotions on a consistent basis, 
					especially when they can also take different forms on these platforms overtime.
					<br><br><br>
					Although this barrier applies internationally, states especially in the US have already 
					taken a role in combatting against fraudulent behaviors driven by these altcoins, with 
					the major example being the state of New York which released a fourth bill that will 
					enforce strict rules on developers seeking to sell over 10% of their ‘altcoin’ supply, 
					especially within a five-year period following a scheme that they could potentially be 
					involved in. Roles in restricting the buying and selling of these ‘altcoins’ nationally are 
					likely to expand and diversify upon various activities that will come up for the future 
					with states elaborating on the idea of better combatting solutions, but for now the 
					responsibility will be largely dependant on how the investor comprehends this speed of 
					information in the traffic of crypto markets.
					<br><br><br>
					Emphasizing on the basic rules that should be followed when ensuring yourself that you 
					aren’t deceived into a ‘pump-and-dump’ scheme disguised as any form of social media 
					campaigning, another real-world example will be used to highlight the common 
					behaviors to take a note of and avoid. In 2021, a scheme was developed by an unofficial 
					company by the name of AnubisDAO run by anonymous developers, seeking to make 
					use of the method in easing the conversion of tokens to cash, by promoting the ability 
					to combine the concept with the already controversial culture of Shiba Inu (SHIB) coins. 
					As mentioned in our video workshop discussing non-fungible tokens, Shiba Inu is 
					largely reliant on spread of mouth and has notably been controlled under this aspect by 
					various influences such as Tesla stock owner and CEO Elon Musk. On the surface level, 
					this may seem like another social media campaign, but the special deception was 
					received by investors under the circsumtances at which no official website appeared to 
					promote the idea or even a potential product behind it. Generally speaking, 
					cryptocurrencies promoting portfolio packages next to websites, also use something a 
					“white paper” which to put it simply, acts as a guide and blueprint of the project at 
					hand. In a matter of 20 hours (less than a day or even a week it usually takes for these 
					pump-and-dump schemes to take effect), 60 million USD in the liquidity pool was 
					immediately depleted from the accounts, creating a major dent in the finances of these 
					investors. Altogether, the main lesson to gain from this event in addition to everything 
					else we’ve discussed thus far, is that as an average user who does not hold the 
					significant level of finances some of the investors involved have suffered the loss of, one 
					must maintain skepticism over certain token-based campaigns that promise to help you 
					build a portfolio, as a lot of these organizations assume that the users do not act as a 
					safeguard over their own assets, hence only following what the company says without 
					making the right observations.
